## Project Overview

CashHandle Token Store is an innovative platform that allows users to create and trade tokens based on HandCash handles. Each token represents a fractional ownership in future payments to that specific HandCash handle, creating a unique financial instrument with automatic dividend distribution.

## Key Features

- **Handle-Based Tokens**: Each HandCash handle becomes a tradeable asset (e.g., @JohnBaker becomes $JohnBaker)
- **Automatic Token Creation**: Connecting your HandCash handle automatically creates your personal token
- **Dividend Distribution**: Payments made to HandCash handles are automatically distributed as dividends to token holders
- **Proportional Ownership**: Each token is backed by 1 billion shares that can be traded freely
- **Marketplace Trading**: Buy and sell tokens representing any HandCash handle
- **Minimum Dividend Threshold**: Only holders with more than 200,000 tokens receive dividends due to network fees
