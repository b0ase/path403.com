## Project Overview

Repository Tokenization is an innovative open-source platform that enables developers to tokenize their GitHub repositories, creating economic incentives for open-source development. The platform automatically generates utility tokens for repositories, allowing contributors to earn rewards based on their contributions and code quality.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Tokenization**: Convert any GitHub repository into a tradeable token
- **Contribution Tracking**: AI-powered analysis of code contributions and quality
- **Developer Rewards**: Token distribution based on commits, code quality, and impact
- **Repository Marketplace**: Trading platform for repository tokens
- **Governance Rights**: Token holders can vote on repository direction and features
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven development

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for robust development experience  
- **Backend**: Node.js with GitHub API integration
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for tokenization
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for repository analytics and user data
- **AI Analysis**: Machine learning for code quality assessment
- **CI/CD**: Automated deployment on Vercel with GitHub Actions

## Platform Features

### Repository Analysis
