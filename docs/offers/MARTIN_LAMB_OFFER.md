# Investment Offer Letter

**To:** Martin Lamb, Orebit
**From:** Richard Boase, b0ase.com
**Date:** January 24, 2026
**Re:** Equity Investment in b0ase.com Ltd

Martin,

I'm writing to invite you to participate in b0ase.com's seed round. Given your work tokenising gold with Orebit, I think you'll appreciate what we're building: **infrastructure for tokenised equity in software companies**.

## The Opportunity

**b0ase.com** is a venture studio that uses AI to build and repair software companies. Our core product, **Kintsugi**, is an AI engine that transforms abandoned software projects into investable, tokenised companies.

Think of it as a factory for creating equity tokens — but instead of tokenising gold, we tokenise software businesses.

### Why Kintsugi Matters

Every year, millions of software projects are abandoned:
- Founders run out of money
- Side projects never ship
- Startups pivot, leaving code orphaned

These projects have real value — architecture, code, sometimes users — but lack resources to complete.

**Kintsugi repairs them.**

```
Founder submits broken project
       ↓
Kintsugi analyzes codebase (AI)
       ↓
Creates repair plan (10 fundable tranches)
       ↓
Investors fund tranches
       ↓
Developers complete work (AI-assisted)
       ↓
Company launches with tokenised cap table
```

The output isn't code. It's a company — with legal structure, shareholders, and tradeable tokens on Bitcoin SV.

## The Offer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Investment** | £100,000 |
| **Equity** | 10% of b0ase.com Ltd |
| **Valuation** | £1,000,000 pre-money |
| **Structure** | SAFE or Convertible Note |
| **Token** | $BOASE (BSV-20) |

### What You Get

**10% of everything we own and create.**

When you invest in b0ase, you don't get one token — you get a proportional allocation in our entire token portfolio:

| Token | Product |
|-------|---------|
| $BOASE | Holding company / platform |
| $KINTSUGI | AI repair engine |
| $DIVVY | Dividend distribution tool |
| $bSheets | Bitcoin Spreadsheets |
| $bOS | Bitcoin Operating System |
| $bWriter | Writing/blogging app |
| $NPG | Gaming platform (85% owned) |
| + 60 more | Full portfolio of domains and products |

**One investment. Entire portfolio. All dividends.**

Revenue from each product flows to token holders automatically via Divvy — our dividend distribution tool built on BSV.

## Why Now

1. **AI can finally write code** — Claude, GPT-4, Gemini are production-ready
2. **Tokenisation infrastructure exists** — BSV-20 provides cheap, scalable equity tokens
3. **Developer shortage** — 4M unfilled jobs globally; AI fills the gap
4. **Project graveyard growing** — More abandoned code than ever

You know better than most how tokenisation changes asset classes. We're applying the same principles to software equity.

## Traction

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Projects in pipeline | 69 |
| Tranches created | 690 |
| Developer services listed | 117 |
| Platform completion | ~70% |
| Agent system completion | 92% |

We're repairing our own companies first (NPG, Bitcoin Corporation products) to prove Kintsugi works before offering it externally.

## Use of Funds

| Allocation | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| Complete Kintsugi engine | £40,000 |
| First 10 external projects | £25,000 |
| Developer/investor acquisition | £20,000 |
| Operational runway | £15,000 |
| **Total** | **£100,000** |

## The Ask

I'm offering you 10% of b0ase.com Ltd for £100,000.

At this valuation, you're getting in at the ground floor of infrastructure that could process hundreds of software projects per year — each generating platform fees, marketplace cuts, and token allocations that flow back to you.

**Next steps:**
1. Review the platform: https://b0ase.com
2. Complete investor onboarding: https://b0ase.com/investors/onboard
3. Schedule a call to discuss

I'd welcome the chance to walk you through Kintsugi in detail. Your experience with Orebit gives you a unique perspective on what tokenised assets can become — I think you'll see the potential here.
