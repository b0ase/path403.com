**Why this structure:**
- No dilution of existing shareholders = no controversy
- Massey's token rights stay scoped to bCorp products only
- NPG minorities' rights stay scoped to $NPG only
- Clean new entity for fundraising ($BOASE)
- Three companies = three annual filings (£13 each + accountant fees)
- b0ase will build tools to manage this (Bitcoin Spreadsheets, etc.)

| **Jurisdiction** | England & Wales |
| **Director** | Richard Boase |
| **Registered Office** | Flat 6, 315 Barking Road, London, E13 8EE |
| **Incorporated** | 2024 |

**Cap Table (Current):**

| Shareholder | Ownership | Investment |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Richard Boase | 99% | Founder |
| Craig Massey | 1% | £1,000 at £100K valuation |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | |

**Craig Massey Investment Terms (November 2024):**

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Shares | 10,000,000 ordinary shares |
| Price | £1,000 (£0.0001/share) |
| Valuation | £100,000 pre-money |
| **Token Rights** | 1% of all tokens issued by bCorp **and its subsidiaries** |

**Specific Token Entitlements (from share certificate):**
- $bCorp, $bOS, $bApps, $bOffice, $bEx, $bWallet, $bWriter
- Plus 1% of any future bCorp subsidiary tokens

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Massey Scope Limitation**

Massey's rights are scoped to **The Bitcoin Corporation Ltd and its subsidiaries only**. They do NOT extend to:
- b0ase.com Ltd (separate company, not a bCorp subsidiary)
- NPG Ltd (not a bCorp subsidiary)
- $BOASE tokens (b0ase platform token)
- Kintsugi-created companies (under b0ase, not bCorp)

**DECISION: Fresh b0ase.com Ltd (No Dilution)**

Incorporate a new holding company. No dilution of existing shareholders.

1. **Incorporate b0ase.com Ltd**
   - Fresh UK Ltd, 100% Richard Boase
   - ~£12 filing fee, 24-48 hours

2. **Open bank account**
   - Tide or Starling (1-2 days)

3. **Transfer Richard's shares to b0ase.com Ltd**
   - Richard's 99% of bCorp → b0ase.com Ltd owns it
   - Richard's 85.35% of NPG → b0ase.com Ltd owns it
   - Stock transfer forms (J30), no shareholder approval needed

4. **Result**
   - b0ase.com Ltd (new company, 100% Richard)
   - Owns 99% of bCorp, 85.35% of NPG
   - Massey keeps 1% of bCorp (no dilution, rights scoped to bCorp)
   - NPG minorities keep 14.65% (no dilution, rights scoped to NPG)
   - Clean cap table for investment

**Why this is better than dilution:**
- No controversy with existing shareholders
- Massey's broad token rights stay scoped to bCorp only
- NPG minorities aren't touched
- Clean story for new investors
- Three annual filings is manageable (and we're building tools for this)

**Products (Open Source):**
- Atomic Contracts
- Bitcoin Apps Platform (19 apps)
- Various BSV development tools

**Note:** All bCorp products are explicitly open source. Revenue comes from services, not licensing.

**Banking:**
- TIDE Bank: Account 28694165, Sort 04-06-05

## Investment Considerations

### SEIS/EIS Eligibility

**⚠️ b0ase.com Ltd likely DOES NOT qualify for SEIS/EIS**

The Financial Conduct Authority excludes businesses dealing in "financial instruments" from SEIS/EIS. Since b0ase.com/Kintsugi:
- Creates tokenized equity securities
- Operates an investment platform
- Facilitates securities transactions

...it falls under the "excluded activities" for SEIS/EIS purposes.

**Entity-specific status:**

| Entity | SEIS/EIS Status | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| b0ase.com Ltd | ❌ Unlikely | Financial instruments exclusion |
| NPG Ltd | ⚠️ Had SEIS | Gaming focus; bank account was blocked (reinstated) |
| Bitcoin Corporation Ltd | ❌ Unlikely | Open source tools, no trading revenue |

**Recommendation:** Do not market b0ase investment as SEIS/EIS eligible. Consult tax specialist if specific projects might qualify separately.

### Investor Structure

```
Investor → Invests in b0ase.com Ltd (equity)
         → Receives $BOASE tokens
         → Gets exposure to:
            ├── Kintsugi platform revenue (100%)
            ├── Bitcoin Corporation Ltd (99% owned)
            │   └── $bOS, $bWriter, $bApps products
            │   └── Massey has 1% (his rights scoped here)
            ├── NPG Ltd (85.35% owned)
            │   └── Gaming/NFT platform
            │   └── Neil, Block Dojo, etc. have 14.65%
            └── Future Kintsugi-created companies (100%)
```

**Token hierarchy:**
- $BOASE = equity in b0ase.com Ltd (the holding company)
- $NPG, $bOS, $bWriter = product/subsidiary tokens (separate from $BOASE)
- Tokens are the PRODUCT - each Kintsugi project outputs its own token
