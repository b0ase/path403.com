# Kintsugi - Executive Summary

**One-Pager for Investors**
**January 2026**

---

## The Company

**b0ase.com** is a venture studio that builds companies using AI.

Our product, **Kintsugi**, is an AI engine that transforms abandoned software projects into investable companies - complete with legal structure, cap table, tokens, investors, and development teams.

Like the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, Kintsugi fills the cracks in abandoned codebases with capital and skilled hands, creating something more valuable than the original.

---

## The Vision: Internet Capital Markets

Traditional capital markets are broken for small companies:
- Accredited investors only
- Paper certificates and spreadsheets
- Geographic restrictions
- Exits only via M&A or IPO

**We're building capital markets for the internet age:**
- Certified investors (self-cert + KYC)
- Tokenized equity on blockchain
- Global by default
- Trade tokens anytime

Kintsugi builds the companies. AI agents do the work. 24/7.

## The Problem

**Millions of software projects are abandoned every year.**

- Founders run out of money
- Side projects never ship
- Startups pivot, leaving code orphaned
- Open source loses maintainers

These projects have real value - architecture, code, users - but lack resources to reach completion. Traditional solutions (hiring, outsourcing, finding co-founders) are slow, expensive, and often fail.

**The result:** A graveyard of half-built products with unrealized potential.

## The Solution

**Kintsugi repairs broken projects and turns them into companies.**

```
Founder submits project
       ↓
Kintsugi analyzes codebase (AI)
       ↓
Creates repair plan (10 tranches)
       ↓
Investors fund tranches (crowd)
       ↓
Developers complete work (marketplace)
       ↓
Company launches with token + cap table
```

**The output isn't code. It's a company.**

Each Kintsugi project becomes:
- A UK Ltd with proper legal structure
- A tokenized cap table (BSV-20)
- An investable asset with real shareholders
- A revenue-generating business
