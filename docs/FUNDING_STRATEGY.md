## Executive Summary

**b0ase** is an AI-powered venture studio that combines agency services, platform tools, Web3 infrastructure, and intelligent automation into a unified ecosystem. We are building the operating system for the creator economy.

### The Opportunity

The creator economy is a $250B+ market with no dominant full-stack solution. Existing players offer fragmented tools: website builders, payment processors, content platforms, or blockchain utilities. **No one combines all four with AI orchestration.**

Our flagship AI system, **Kintsugi**, is positioned to become the intelligent layer that connects idea to execution. Think "Notion meets Stripe meets Shopify" - but with AI agents that actually build, deploy, and operate the business on behalf of creators and founders.

### What We've Built

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Codebase Size | 35,000+ files |
| Source Files (TS/TSX/MD) | 1,231 files |
| API Routes | 500+ endpoints |
| Database Models | 100+ tables |
| Features Built | 100+ complete modules |
| Agent System Completion | 92% |
| Developer Marketplace | Live (117 services) |

### The Ask

**Seed Round: GBP 50,000 - 100,000**

Convertible note or SAFE with 6-8x valuation cap based on current traction and infrastructure value.

## The Opportunity

### Market Size

| Segment | Market Size (2025) | Growth Rate |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Creator Economy | $250B | 15% CAGR |
| No-Code/Low-Code | $45B | 24% CAGR |
| AI Automation | $35B | 40% CAGR |
| Web3/Blockchain | $65B | 25% CAGR |
| Digital Agencies | $400B | 8% CAGR |

**Total Addressable Market:** $250B+ (creator economy alone)

**Serviceable Market:** $5B (tech-enabled creator services)

**Initial Target:** $50M (UK-based creators and founders seeking AI-automated business setup)

### The Gap

Current solutions are fragmented:

| Need | Current Solutions | Problem |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Website | Wix, Squarespace, Webflow | No AI, no automation |
| Payments | Stripe, Gumroad | No site building |
| Content | Notion, Ghost | No commerce |
| Blockchain | Various Web3 tools | Developer-only |
| Automation | Zapier, Make | Requires manual setup |
| Full Service | Traditional agencies | Expensive ($20K-100K+) |

**b0ase fills the gap:** Full-stack infrastructure + AI agents + blockchain provenance + automated operations - all in one platform.

### The Kintsugi Vision

Kintsugi is our AI orchestration engine that:

1. **Discovers** - Talks to founders, extracts their idea, validates market fit
2. **Proposes** - Generates a complete project proposal with tokenomics and pricing
3. **Creates** - Spawns a GitHub repository, blockchain inscription, and token contract
4. **Deploys** - Launches website, sets up payments, configures automation
5. **Operates** - AI agents handle marketing, support, and ongoing operations

**End Goal:** A founder describes their idea in plain language. Kintsugi builds and operates their entire business.

## Why Now

### AI Automation Tools Have Matured

- We're 18 months ahead of anyone trying to build this from scratch

### Technical Foundation Already Built

- 35,000+ file codebase operational
- 100+ features deployed and tested
- Agent system 92% complete
- Blockchain infrastructure connected

| **Key Person** | Documented codebase, hiring plan, can onboard devs quickly |
| **Regulatory** | UK-based, GDPR compliant, blockchain operations transparent |
