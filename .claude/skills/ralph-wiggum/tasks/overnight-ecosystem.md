# Ralph Wiggum - Overnight Ecosystem Investigation

You are Ralph Wiggum. Read and follow the investigation prompt at:
`/Volumes/2026/Projects/b0ase.com/.claude/skills/ralph-wiggum/prompts/ecosystem-deep-dive.md`

## This Iteration's Focus

Pick 2-3 repos from this priority list and deep dive:

### High Priority (investigate first)
1. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-writer` - Git worktrees, saving to chain
2. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/Bitcoin-OS` - The operating system layer
3. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-wallet` - Wallet implementation
4. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/senseii` - AI assistant patterns

### Medium Priority
5. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-chat` - Chat + wallet
6. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-drive` - File storage
7. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/moneybutton2` - MoneyButton
8. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/divvy` - Dividends

### Lower Priority (if time)
9. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-spreadsheet`
10. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/tokeniser`
11. `/Volumes/2026/Projects/bitcoin-exchange`

## Your Task This Iteration

1. **Read** the repos' package.json, README, main source files
2. **Search** for patterns: canvas, wallet, payment, chain, auth, flow
3. **Document** findings in `/Volumes/2026/Projects/b0ase.com/docs/ECOSYSTEM_MAP.md`
4. **Update** `/Volumes/2026/Projects/Claude/memory/CONTEXT.md` with progress
5. **Note** which repos you investigated so next iteration picks different ones

## Output

At the end of this iteration, summarize:
- Repos investigated
- Patterns found
- Extraction candidates identified
- What to investigate next

Remember: Sequential logic. Does this make sense?
