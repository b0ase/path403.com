# Human-First Blog Writing

Write blog posts that sound like a person talking, not a corporate content mill.

## When to Use

Use this skill when writing any blog post for b0ase.com.

## The Rules

### 1. Write like you talk

Bad:
> "At b0ase, we've developed a comprehensive tokenization solution that enables entrepreneurs to transform their innovative concepts into blockchain-based assets."

Good:
> "You've got an idea. We'll turn it into a token. That's it."

### 2. Short sentences. Short paragraphs.

One thought per sentence. One idea per paragraph. Let the reader breathe.

### 3. No corporate speak

Kill these words:
- "comprehensive"
- "innovative"
- "leverage"
- "synergy"
- "solution"
- "utilize"
- "facilitate"
- "streamline"
- "cutting-edge"
- "best-in-class"

Replace with plain English.

### 4. Be direct

Bad:
> "We believe that ownership should be accessible and liquid from the very beginning of your entrepreneurial journey."

Good:
> "Your earliest supporters should be your investors, not just your followers."

### 5. Use "you" and "we"

Write to a person. Not "users" or "customers" or "stakeholders." Just "you."

### 6. One clear offer

Every post should have one thing the reader can do. Not three CTAs and a newsletter signup. One thing.

### 7. Cut the fluff

If a sentence doesn't add information or move the reader forward, delete it.

Bad intro:
> "In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, entrepreneurs face unprecedented challenges when it comes to launching their products and establishing their brand presence in the marketplace."

Good intro:
> "You've got an idea. You want it to exist. Here's how."

### 8. Specific beats vague

Bad:
> "Our affordable pricing makes tokenization accessible to everyone."

Good:
> "$1000. That's it."

### 9. No AI summary sections

Don't add "Summary for AI Readers" or "Core Thesis" sections. Those are for robots. Write for humans and the robots will figure it out.

### 10. End with action

Don't end with a summary. End with what to do next.

Bad:
> "In conclusion, tokenization offers numerous benefits for entrepreneurs looking to launch their products quickly and efficiently."

Good:
> "Email richard@b0ase.com. This time tomorrow, you could have something real."

## Frontmatter

Keep it minimal:

```yaml
---
title: "Short, punchy title"
description: "One sentence. What's the post about?"
date: "2026-01-30"
author: "Richard Boase"
featured: true
image: /images/blog/your-image.jpg
slug: your-post-slug
---
```

That's it. No "audience", "topics", "canonical", "markdown" fields unless specifically needed.

## Structure

```markdown
## Hook

One or two sentences. Why should they keep reading?

## The thing

What are you telling them? Be specific.

## Why it matters

What's in it for them?

## How it works

Simple steps. Numbered if sequential.

## Call to action

One thing. What do they do next?
```

## Examples

### Bad (robot voice)

> ## Introduction
>
> In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain technology, tokenization has emerged as a transformative force that enables entrepreneurs to reimagine traditional business models. At b0ase, we have developed a comprehensive suite of services designed to facilitate the seamless transition of innovative concepts into blockchain-based assets.
>
> ## Our Value Proposition
>
> Our tokenization package provides entrepreneurs with access to a full-stack development solution that includes token creation, website development, email configuration, hosting services, and AI-powered social media management.

### Good (human voice)

> ## Here's the deal
>
> You've got an idea. Maybe you've been sitting on it for months. Maybe you sketched it on a napkin last week. Doesn't matter.
>
> What matters is this: you want it to exist, and you don't want to spend six months and fifty grand making it happen.
>
> So here's what we'll do.
>
> ## $1000. That's it.
>
> For a thousand dollars, we'll set you up with a token, a website, email, hosting, AI socials, and an MVP if you need one.

## Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] Could I say this out loud without feeling stupid?
- [ ] Is there one clear thing the reader should do?
- [ ] Did I cut every sentence that doesn't need to be there?
- [ ] Are there any corporate buzzwords left?
- [ ] Does it start with something interesting, not a preamble?
- [ ] Does it end with action, not summary?

Bad patterns to avoid:

- Anything with "In this article, we will explore..."
