⏺ Handoff Summary

  Completed ✅

  1. Fixed clickable contract rows on /contracts page - entire row now navigates to contract detail
  2. Fixed column name bugs in 4 marketplace API files:
    - app/api/marketplace/developers/search/route.ts
    - app/api/marketplace/agents/search/route.ts
    - app/api/marketplace/contracts/user/route.ts
    - app/api/marketplace/contracts/[id]/inscribe/route.ts
    - Changed github_username → username (database has username column, not github_username)
  3. Added debug logging to developers search endpoint to diagnose production error
  4. Built and pushed all changes to production

  Still Investigating 🔍

  Issue: /api/marketplace/developers/search returns 500 error in production (but works locally)
  - Works fine at http://localhost:3000/api/marketplace/developers/search
  - Returns 500 at https://www.b0ase.com/api/marketplace/developers/search
  - Suggests: Prisma client generation issue or missing env var on Vercel

  Latest deployment (commit 720045d) includes full error logging - check production after restart to see actual error details:
  curl -s 'https://www.b0ase.com/api/marketplace/developers/search?sort=recent' | jq

  Next Steps When You Return

  1. Wait ~1-2 minutes for Vercel deployment to complete
  2. Check the endpoint again - should now return error details in response
  3. Diagnose root cause from error message/stack trace
  4. Fix and deploy

  All code changes committed and pushed. Safe to restart. 👍
