## Timeline

**2-3 business days** from order to completion

- Day 1: Speed audit & optimization plan
- Day 2: Implementation of optimizations
- Day 3: Testing & verification

## Requirements

**You must provide:**
- Website URL
- Access to website files/hosting (FTP, cPanel, or Git)
- Current hosting provider info

## What We Optimize

**Images (Usually the #1 slowdown):**
- Compress all images (70-90% size reduction)
- Convert to modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement lazy loading
- Responsive images (srcset)
- Remove unused images
- Image CDN (optional)

**Code:**
- Minify HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Remove unused CSS/JS
- Defer non-critical JavaScript
- Inline critical CSS
- Code splitting
- Tree shaking (remove dead code)

**Caching:**
- Browser caching (leverage cache headers)
- Page caching
- Object caching (if applicable)
- Database query caching
- CDN caching

**Server:**
- Enable compression (Gzip/Brotli)
- Optimize server response time
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
- Keep-alive connections
- Reduce redirects

**Database (if applicable):**
- Query optimization
- Database indexing
- Remove unnecessary queries
- Lazy loading of data

**Third-Party Scripts:**
- Audit slow scripts (Google Tag Manager, ads, etc.)
- Defer non-critical scripts
- Remove unused tracking codes
- Optimize font loading

**Core Web Vitals:**
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) <2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay) <100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift) <0.1

## Performance Targets

**Before optimization (typical site):**
- PageSpeed Score: 30-60
- Load time: 5-15 seconds
- Page size: 5-15 MB
- Requests: 100-200

**After optimization:**
- PageSpeed Score: 85-95+
- Load time: <2 seconds
- Page size: <1 MB
- Requests: <50

## Speed = Conversions

**Research shows:**
- 1s delay = 7% conversion loss
- 53% users abandon sites >3s load
- Fast sites rank higher on Google
- Mobile users expect <3s loads
- Every 100ms faster = 1% more revenue

**Faster site = more customers.**
