# I will design a complete tokenomics model for your project for £300

Create sustainable token economics that align incentives and drive long-term value.

## What you get

- ✅ Token distribution model
- ✅ Supply schedule & vesting
- ✅ Pricing mechanism design (bonding curve, fixed, dynamic)
- ✅ Utility & value accrual analysis
- ✅ Governance model
- ✅ Incentive structure
- ✅ Economic sustainability analysis
- ✅ Competitor analysis
- ✅ Visual diagrams & charts
- ✅ 15-page tokenomics document
- ✅ Presentation deck (10 slides)
- ✅ 1 revision round

## Timeline

**3-5 business days** from order to delivery

- Day 1: Research & competitor analysis
- Day 2-3: Model development
- Day 4: Documentation & visualization
- Day 5: Revisions & final delivery

## Requirements

**You must provide:**
- Project overview (what problem you're solving)
- Target user personas
- Business model (how you make money)
- Token utility ideas (how token will be used)
- Funding goals (if doing token sale)

**Optional:**
- Existing tokenomics to improve
- Comparable projects
- Specific constraints (legal, technical)

## What's Included

### 1. Supply Model
- Total supply calculation
- Inflation/deflation schedule
- Emission rate over time
- Burn mechanisms (if applicable)
- Maximum cap justification

### 2. Distribution Model
- Team allocation (% and vesting)
- Investor allocation (% and vesting)
- Community allocation
- Treasury/DAO reserves
- Marketing/ecosystem fund
- Advisors/partners

### 3. Vesting Schedules
- Cliff periods
- Linear vs. stepped vesting
- Unlock timelines
- Lock-up justifications

### 4. Pricing Mechanism
- **Bonding Curve** - Algorithmic price discovery
- **Fixed Price** - Token sale at set price
- **Dynamic Pricing** - Market-driven with controls
- **Milestone-Based** - Price increases with achievements

We recommend the best fit for your project.

### 5. Utility & Value Accrual
- How token is used in your ecosystem
- Value capture mechanisms
- Staking rewards (if applicable)
- Governance rights
- Fee discounts
- Access control
- Buyback/burn programs

### 6. Game Theory Analysis
- Stakeholder incentive alignment
- Attack vectors & mitigations
- Long-term vs. short-term holder balance
- Whale prevention strategies
- Sybil resistance

### 7. Economic Sustainability
- Revenue vs. token emissions
- Break-even analysis
- Growth scenarios (best/base/worst case)
- 5-year projection model

### 8. Governance Model
- Voting mechanisms
- Proposal system
- Quorum requirements
- Time locks
- Multi-sig setup

## Why Tokenomics Matter

Bad tokenomics kill projects:
- ❌ Team dumps tokens → price crashes
- ❌ No utility → no demand → no value
- ❌ Hyperinflation → constant sell pressure
- ❌ Misaligned incentives → community leaves

Good tokenomics create value:
- ✅ Fair distribution → community trust
- ✅ Real utility → sustainable demand
- ✅ Balanced emissions → healthy price action
- ✅ Aligned incentives → long-term growth

2. **Presentation Deck** (PDF + Keynote, 10 slides)
   - Investor-ready
   - Visual token distribution pie chart
   - Vesting timeline gantt chart
   - Supply schedule graph

## Examples

Sample tokenomics we've designed:

**AI Content Engine Token:**
- 1M supply, milestone-based release
- Bonding curve pricing (0.001 → 0.01 BSV)
- 5 milestones over 285 days
- Community voting on completion

**DeFi Protocol Token:**
- 100M supply, deflationary
- 3% team (3yr vest), 20% DAO, 77% liquidity mining
- Governance rights + fee sharing
- Burn 0.1% per transaction

**Gaming NFT Token:**
- 500M supply, capped
- In-game utility (buy items, enter tournaments)
- Staking rewards (5% APY)
- 50% play-to-earn rewards pool

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do you help with the token launch?**
A: This service is just design. We can deploy tokens separately (£800 for BSV)

**Q: Can you design for any blockchain?**
A: Yes, but we specialize in BSV and recommend it for most use cases

**Q: What if I don't like the initial model?**
A: One revision round included. Additional revisions £50 each.

**Q: Do you guarantee success?**
A: No. Tokenomics is one piece. Product-market fit, execution, and timing also matter.

**Q: Can you model complex mechanisms (ve-tokenomics, Olympus-style bonds)?**
A: Yes, upgrade to Advanced Modeling (+£200) for complex mechanisms

## Legal

- We provide economic design, not financial advice
- You're responsible for legal compliance
- We can sign NDA if needed
- No refunds after delivery
