- ✅ Business logic review
- ✅ Detailed audit report (15+ pages)
- ✅ Severity-rated findings (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- ✅ Remediation recommendations
- ✅ Re-audit after fixes (1 round)
- ✅ Security certificate (if passed)

## Timeline

**3-7 business days** depending on complexity

- Day 1: Initial scan & automated tools
- Day 2-4: Manual review & testing
- Day 5: Report writing
- Day 6: Deliver report
- Day 7: Re-audit after you fix issues

## Supported Chains

- **Bitcoin SV** (sCrypt, Bitcoin Script)
- **Ethereum** (Solidity)
- **Polygon** (Solidity)
- **Binance Smart Chain** (Solidity)
- **Arbitrum** (Solidity)
- **Solana** (Rust)

**We specialize in BSV smart contracts.**

## What We Check

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control issues
- Front-running risks
- Oracle manipulation
- Flash loan attacks
- Timestamp dependence
- Delegatecall vulnerabilities
- Uninitialized storage pointers
- tx.origin authentication

### Business Logic
- Does the contract do what it claims?
- Are edge cases handled?
- Can funds get locked?
- Are there admin backdoors?
- Are economics sound?

### Gas Optimization
- Expensive operations
- Storage vs. memory usage
- Loop optimizations
- Redundant code
- Batch operations

### Code Quality
- Follows best practices
- Clear variable naming
- Adequate comments
- Uses established patterns
- Upgradability (if applicable)

## Audit Process

### 1. Scoping
- You provide contract source code
- We estimate complexity
- Define audit boundaries

### 2. Automated Scanning
- Run security tools (Slither, Mythril, etc.)
- Static analysis
- Quick vulnerability detection

### 3. Manual Review
- Line-by-line code analysis
- Business logic verification
- Attack scenario testing
- Economic model review

### 4. Testing
- Deploy on testnet
- Attempt exploits
- Fuzz testing
- Edge case validation

### 5. Reporting
- Document all findings
- Categorize by severity
- Provide fix recommendations
- Include code examples

### 6. Re-Audit
- You fix issues
- We verify fixes
- Issue security certificate (if all critical/high fixed)

## Deliverables

You receive:

**1. Audit Report (PDF)**
