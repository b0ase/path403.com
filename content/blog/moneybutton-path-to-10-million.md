## What If Pressing a Button Could Make You $10 Million?

I know, I know. Sounds like clickbait. But hear me out.

What if the simplest possible action on the internet—pressing a button—could generate $10 million in revenue? Not through advertising. Not through subscriptions. Not through some VC extracting value from your attention.

Through pure, undiluted dopamine economics.

That's exactly what we're building at [TheMoneyButton.store](https://themoneybutton.store).

## Here's the Deal: Less Than a Penny Per Press

So here's the proposition. You press a button. You pay $0.0099. That's it—less than a penny. The kind of money that falls between your couch cushions. The kind of money you literally wouldn't bend down to pick up off the street.

But here's the twist: you get equity back.

Equity in what exactly? Well, that's part of the fun. You might get [$MONEYBUTTON tokens](https://1sat.market/bsv21/moneybutton). You might get [$BOASE](https://1sat.market/bsv21/boase). Maybe [$BSHEETS](https://1sat.market/bsv21/bsheets) from [Bitcoin Spreadsheets](https://bitcoin-spreadsheet.vercel.app/). Maybe a token from a project you've never even heard of.

Every press is basically a micro-lottery for ownership across an entire ecosystem.

You're not buying a consumable here. You're buying mystery ownership. A penny buys you a ticket to projects you didn't know existed. Pretty wild, right?

## The Math Actually Works Out

Let me break down the numbers because they're kind of beautiful.

There are one billion $MONEYBUTTON tokens in existence. At $0.0099 per token, that's a fully diluted market cap of $9.9 million—almost exactly $10M when you account for the decimals.

The math is elegant. The execution is addictive. And the viral mechanics? Unlike anything the crypto space has seen before.

## It's a Game Pretending to Be Finance

Here's what I love about [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store): it's not a financial instrument pretending to be fun. It's a game pretending to be a financial instrument.

Every press triggers a cascade of feedback. Sound effects. Visual explosions. Token counters incrementing. Chaos levels escalating. Press enough times and the button itself transforms—borders glow brighter, animations intensify, the whole experience shifts from calm to chaos to... something transcendent.

This isn't accidental. It's engineered dopamine delivery.

We borrowed the psychology from the most addictive experiences ever designed: slot machines, mobile games, social media feeds. But instead of extracting value through dark patterns, MoneyButton gives value back. Every penny you spend returns real, tradeable equity. You just don't know which tokens until you press.

It's gambling and investing at the same time. A lottery where every ticket actually wins something.

## The Viral Part Gets Interesting

Okay, here's where the economics get really fun.

Every [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store) press seeds your wallet with equity you weren't expecting. The tokens change depending on where you are, what you're doing, what's launching that week.

Visit the [blog](/blog)? Maybe you get $BLOG tokens. The [portfolio page](/portfolio) might drop $PORTFOLIO tokens. Or it might surprise you with equity in a brand new project nobody's seen yet.

You never quite know what you're accumulating. That's the point.

But [b0ase.com](/) is just the beginning.

The MoneyButton appears on every [Bitcoin Corporation](https://www.thebitcoincorporation.website) product: [Bitcoin Writer](https://bitcoin-writer.vercel.app/), [Bitcoin Spreadsheets](https://bitcoin-spreadsheet.vercel.app/), and the growing ecosystem of tools we're building for the Bitcoin-native internet.

Each product has its own equity token. Each press makes you a shareholder in another project. Every product you use? You own a piece of it.

This is viral coefficient engineering at its finest. Every user who presses becomes an owner. Every owner has incentive to share. Every share creates new pressers who become new owners who share again.

The button doesn't just spread—it compounds.

## You Can Mint Your Own MoneyButton (For Free)

Here's the most powerful part: anyone can mint their own [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store).

Connect your [HandCash wallet](https://handcash.io), choose your handle, and boom—you have your own MoneyButton. Completely free. Your button, your brand, your token economy.

Want to add a MoneyButton to your personal site? Just embed it. Building a web app? Include it. Launching a vibe? Every project gets its own button, its own token, its own economy.

The implications here are kind of staggering.

Imagine you're a vibecoder—someone who rapidly prototypes and ships products using AI-assisted development. Maybe you're using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or building with our [developer tools](/developers). You launch ten projects in a month. Each project has a MoneyButton. Each button mints its own token. Each token creates its own community of holders who are now economically aligned with your success.

You're not just building products anymore. You're seeding economies.

## The Leaderboards Create a New Status Game

This brings us to something I'm really excited about: the leaderboards.

On [b0ase.com](/), we track the most prolific MoneyButton creators. How many buttons have you minted? How many presses have your buttons received? How many unique holders exist across your token ecosystems?

Traditional developer metrics measure commits, contributions, stars on GitHub. Vibecoder metrics measure economic impact: tokens minted, value created, communities seeded.

The most successful vibecoiners—those who build relentlessly, ship constantly, and embed [MoneyButtons](https://themoneybutton.store) everywhere—climb the rankings. Their aggregate token holdings grow. Their influence compounds.

This isn't gamification of development. It's the financialization of creative output, made accessible through the simplest possible interface: a button that costs less than a penny to press.

## Let's Talk Real Numbers

One billion tokens at $0.0099 each equals $9.9 million in gross revenue if every token is minted. But that's just the primary market.

Secondary markets create additional value. [$MONEYBUTTON](https://1sat.market/bsv21/moneybutton) becomes tradeable on [1Sat Market](https://1sat.market). [$BOASE](https://1sat.market/bsv21/boase) becomes tradeable. Every page token, every project token, every custom button token—all tradeable.

The MoneyButton ecosystem doesn't capture this secondary value directly, but it creates it. Every dollar of trading volume traces back to a penny press.

Now consider velocity. If the same tokens trade hands multiple times, the effective economic activity multiplies. A single token minted for $0.0099 might trade for $0.10, then $0.50, then $2.00 as the ecosystem grows.

The original penny becomes a hundred-dollar bill of economic activity.

This is the power of micropayment economies: they're not about transaction size. They're about volume and velocity.

## Why We Built This on Bitcoin (BSV)

[MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store) runs on [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.com), and this isn't arbitrary.

The economics of sub-penny transactions require a blockchain that can actually handle them. Most chains would eat the entire transaction value in fees. Ethereum would charge you $5 to press a button that costs $0.01. The unit economics just don't work.

BSV transaction fees measure in fractions of a cent. A $0.0099 payment can actually be a $0.0099 payment—not a $0.0099 payment plus a $3.00 fee.

This matters for the game mechanics. Users need to press rapidly, repeatedly, compulsively. Any friction—any fee that makes them pause and consider—breaks the dopamine loop.

BSV also provides the scalability for viral growth. Millions of button presses per day? Billions per year? The network can handle it.

We're not on BSV for ideological reasons. We're on BSV because it's the only chain where the economics actually work.

## The HandCash Experience Makes It Accessible

Authentication and payments run through [HandCash](https://handcash.io), which honestly deserves its own shoutout.

HandCash is a Bitcoin wallet designed for actual humans. Users authenticate with a simple handle (like $username), not a 64-character address. Payments happen in USD terms, converted automatically to Bitcoin. It feels like Venmo or Cash App, not like traditional crypto.

This matters for adoption. [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store) needs to onboard users who have never touched cryptocurrency. The HandCash flow makes this possible: sign up, fund your wallet with a card, start pressing. No seed phrases. No gas management. No bridge transactions.

The goal is to make pressing the button feel as natural as liking a social media post. HandCash makes that possible.

## The Roadmap to $10M

Here's how we're thinking about growth.

**Phase one** is seeding: get MoneyButtons embedded across as many sites and products as possible. Every [b0ase.com](/) property has one. Every [Bitcoin Corporation](https://www.thebitcoincorporation.website) tool has one. Every vibecoder who builds with our tools gets one.

**Phase two** is virality: create mechanics that make users want to share. Leaderboards, referral bonuses, holder rewards, trading competitions. Every feature designed to increase press velocity.

**Phase three** is ecosystem: develop secondary markets, token utilities, governance mechanisms. $MONEYBUTTON holders get dividends from the press pool. High-ranking vibecoiners get platform benefits. Token holdings unlock features.

**Phase four** is scale: one million daily active pressers, each pressing ten times per day. That's ten million presses daily, $99,000 in daily revenue, $36 million annually.

The $10M milestone isn't the ceiling. It's the proof of concept.

## Why Less-Than-A-Penny Is Psychologically Perfect

There's something powerful about the $0.0099 price point.

It's not a penny. It's *less* than a penny. It feels like nothing. The cognitive load of deciding whether to press is nearly zero.

But it's also not free. There's just enough friction to create commitment. Just enough cost to create value. Free tokens feel worthless. Tokens you paid something for—even a fraction of a cent—feel earned.

Every behavioral economist knows that free is a different category than cheap. [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store) lives in the cheap category, but at the absolute floor of it.

The lowest possible price that still counts as a price.

## What You're Really Buying Into

When you press the [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store), you're not just buying tokens.

You're buying membership in an experiment. An experiment in micropayment economics, in viral tokenization, in the gamification of value creation.

You're buying exposure to a network that might grow exponentially—or might not. The tokens might become valuable, or they might remain novelty items. That uncertainty is part of the game.

But you're also buying entertainment. The press itself is genuinely fun. The animations, the sounds, the chaos escalation—it's a game worth playing even if the tokens go to zero.

The best crypto projects create value that exists independent of price. MoneyButton is fun first, investment second. The token economics are a bonus layer on top of an experience that stands alone.

## Can We Actually Hit $10M?

Will [MoneyButton](https://themoneybutton.store) reach $10M in revenue?

Here's what needs to happen: one billion presses. Sounds like a lot until you run the scenarios.

- 10,000 users × 100,000 presses each = 1 billion
- 100,000 users × 10,000 presses each = 1 billion
- 1,000,000 users × 1,000 presses each = 1 billion

The numbers are achievable. Not guaranteed—but achievable.

And every press gets us closer. Every press mints tokens, seeds holders, creates stakeholders who want to see this ecosystem succeed.

The question isn't whether the model works. The MoneyButton on [b0ase.com](/) already proves it works. The question is whether it scales—whether the viral mechanics compound, whether the dopamine loops sustain, whether the network effects kick in.

We're betting they will.

## Ready to Press?

The MoneyButton is live at [TheMoneyButton.store](https://themoneybutton.store).

It's integrated on [b0ase.com](/), on [Bitcoin Writer](https://bitcoin-writer.vercel.app/), on [Bitcoin Spreadsheets](https://bitcoin-spreadsheet.vercel.app/), on every property in our ecosystem.

Your own MoneyButton is waiting to be minted. Connect your [HandCash wallet](https://handcash.io), claim your handle, start building your own token economy.

The path to $10M is paved one penny at a time. One press at a time. One token at a time.

And every press makes the next press more likely.

See you on the leaderboards.
