Real World Assets — RWAs — is one of those crypto terms that sounds precise until you actually think about it. And once you do, it starts to itch. The term is typically used as a catch-all to describe off-chain assets like real estate, commodities, or securities that are tokenised and brought on-chain. But this definition papers over a fundamental confusion.

## The Physical vs. The Legal

Let's start with the obvious. Gold is real. Copper is real. Oil, wheat, and lithium are real. They are physical, deliverable, and non-negotiable in the literal sense. You don't agree gold into existence. You dig it out of the ground. You can bail it, warehouse it, transport it, assay it, insure it, and crucially, hand it to someone else without asking permission from any authority.

If the world's databases disappeared tomorrow, gold would still be gold. That's real real.

## Stocks Are Not Things

Now compare that to stocks and shares. A share in a company is not a thing — it's a contractual claim. It exists because a legal system recognises it, a company register records it, and courts are willing to enforce it.

Stocks are negotiable instruments, not deliverable commodities. You don't take delivery of Apple stock the way you take delivery of a bar of gold. You hold a bundle of rights — voting, dividends, residual claims — that only function inside a legal framework.

That doesn't make them fake. But it doesn't make them physical reality either. So when people casually lump securities into RWAs, something feels off.

## Real Compared to What

To be fair, a stock is more real than a memecoin. A memecoin usually represents nothing enforceable, nothing productive, and nothing outside its own ledger. A share represents a company, people, assets, contracts, and activity in the world.

So yes, stocks are real relative to crypto-native abstractions. But calling them real world assets using the same category as gold and copper collapses an important distinction. They are not real in the same way.

## Digital Reality Is Still Reality

Here's where this gets interesting. Stocks aren't physical, but they are real in a different sense: they are real digital constructs backed by law, work, and coordination.

This is where the language needs to evolve. The modern economy isn't built on physical stuff alone anymore. It's built on software, websites, intellectual property, contracts, media, reputation, labour, and networks. None of these are gold. All of these are real.

## What b0ase.com Is Actually Doing

At b0ase.com, we're not pretending everything is a bar of gold. We're putting real digital things on-chain. That includes real stocks and shares in startups, founders and their ongoing work, websites and online businesses, developers and their output, contracts, media, pictures, videos, revenue streams, claims, and agreements.

These aren't RWAs in the commodity sense. They're digitally-native realities — things that already exist as contracts, relationships, labour, and coordination, but are badly represented by legacy systems.

We're not tokenising gold. We're tokenising what actually runs the modern world.

## Conclusion

RWA tries to reassure people by saying don't worry, this is real. But real isn't one thing. There's physical reality like gold, legal reality like shares, and digital reality like software, media, and contracts.

Trying to squash all of that into one bucket is lazy thinking. The future isn't about dragging physical stuff onto blockchains for vibes. It's about making already-real digital things legible, ownable, and composable.

That's the layer we're building.
