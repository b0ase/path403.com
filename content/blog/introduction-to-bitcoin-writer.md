Bitcoin Writer is a word processor that commits your writing to Bitcoin.

Write your document. Pay one penny per page. Your words are immutably recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, timestamped forever, and provably yours.

No one can alter it. No one can rewrite history. And no company — including us — can take it away.

## Why Put Writing on Bitcoin?

The internet forgets.

Websites disappear. Platforms shut down. Files get deleted, edited, or silently changed.

That blog post you wrote in 2010? Gone. Those terms you agreed to? Updated without notice. That receipt, contract, or announcement? Lost to time.

Bitcoin is different.

Once data is written to Bitcoin, it becomes part of a public, immutable ledger. Not because a company promises to keep it online — but because the network itself enforces history.

No central owner. No terms of service changes. No single point of failure.

When you publish with Bitcoin Writer, your document is cryptographically committed to Bitcoin. A hundred years from now, anyone can verify exactly what was written — and when.

Bitcoin doesn't forget.

## How It Works

Bitcoin Writer works like any other word processor.

You write your document. When you're ready, you publish it and pay one penny per page.

That's it.

Your content is written to Bitcoin as part of a blockchain transaction. You receive a $bWriter token — one token per page — representing your published work and its on-chain commitment.

The blockchain proves when it was written. The data proves what was written. The token proves which pages are yours.

## What Can You Write?

Anything that matters enough to last.

**Legal documents.** Contracts, agreements, policies, terms of service. Fix a version in time so no one can later claim it said something else.

**Creative work.** Essays, poems, stories, manifestos. Establish authorship publicly and permanently — no registration required.

**Personal records.** Letters to your future self. Messages to your children. A diary meant to outlive you.

**Business records.** Decisions, announcements, meeting notes. Create an immutable audit trail that can't be rewritten.

If it matters, it belongs on a ledger that doesn't change.

## One Penny Per Page

We charge $0.01 per page.

Why so cheap?

Because we're not running a traditional storage service. We're not selling subscriptions. We're not promising hosting, uptime, or backups.

Bitcoin already does the hard part.

You pay the network once to permanently commit your words to its ledger. We simply make that process easy.

## Your Token, Your Proof

When you publish, you receive a $bWriter token.

This token represents:
- Your published pages
- Their on-chain commitment
- Their permanent timestamp

Think of it like a deed, not a Dropbox file.

The blockchain is the record. The token is your proof.

You can hold your tokens in a compatible wallet, transfer them, gift them, or keep them forever. Ownership is yours.

## Optional: Become a Shareholder

If you want more than permanence, you can stake your tokens.

After completing KYC verification, you may stake your $bWriter tokens with the platform and become a shareholder in Bitcoin Writer.

- 50% of all platform revenue is distributed to stakers
- Dividends are split proportionally by tokens staked
- The remaining 50% covers development and infrastructure

While tokens are staked:
- We index and serve the associated content through our platform
- You earn ongoing dividends
- We handle operational costs

## Unstake Anytime

Staking is optional — and reversible.

You can unstake your tokens at any time:
- Your tokens are returned immediately
- You stop earning dividends
- Your content is removed from our hosted services

What doesn't change?

Your document is still on Bitcoin. Your proof still exists. Your writing was never under our control.

That's the point.

## The Economics

For writers: One penny per page. Permanent, verifiable publication. Optional dividend participation.

For stakers: 50% of all platform revenue. Income scales with platform usage. No lock-in.

For the network: More real utility. More data written on-chain. More economic activity.

Aligned incentives. No rent-seeking. No hostage data.

## Why Bitcoin (BSV)?

"Forever" only works if the foundation lasts.

Bitcoin is the longest-running, most battle-tested blockchain in existence. It has operated continuously since 2009 and is designed to preserve history — not rewrite it.

We use Bitcoin SV (BSV) because it supports:
- Large on-chain data
- Low transaction fees
- Scalable utility use cases

One penny per page is possible because BSV was designed for data at scale.

## Public by Design

Documents published with Bitcoin Writer are public.

That's not a bug — it's the feature.

Public means:
- Verifiable
- Auditable
- Censorship-resistant

If you need private or encrypted storage, use another tool. If you want public, permanent proof, this is exactly what Bitcoin is for.

## Get Started

Ready to write something permanent?

Visit bitcoin-writer.com. Write your document. Pay your penny. Your words are committed to Bitcoin.

Stake if you want to participate in the platform. Don't if you don't.

Either way, your writing lasts.

## The Choice

Two paths. Same permanence.

**Just write:** Publish once. Hold your token. Walk away. Your words are on-chain.

**Write and participate:** Stake your tokens. Earn dividends. Help grow the platform.

Your writing is permanent either way. The only question is how involved you want to be.
