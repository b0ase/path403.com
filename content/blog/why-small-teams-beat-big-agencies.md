There's a persistent myth in business that bigger is better. More people means more capability. More overhead means more professionalism. More process means more reliability. After years of working both sides—inside agencies and as a lean operation—I can tell you the opposite is true.

## The Agency Overhead Problem

Traditional agencies operate on a model that made sense twenty years ago. You need account managers to handle client communication. Project managers to coordinate work. Junior developers to do the grunt work. Senior developers to review it. QA teams to test it. And executives to approve everything.

Each layer adds cost. Each layer adds delay. Each layer adds opportunities for miscommunication. By the time your requirements pass through five people, they've mutated into something you didn't ask for.

The billing reflects this structure. Agencies charge for all those salaries, all that office space, all those meetings where people talk about doing work instead of doing it. A simple landing page that should cost a few hundred pounds ends up costing thousands. A basic app that should take weeks takes months.

## What Actually Matters

Clients don't care about your org chart. They care about three things: does the work meet their requirements, does it arrive on time, and does it stay within budget. Everything else is internal theatre.

A small team—or even a single skilled person with the right tools—can deliver on all three better than most agencies. Here's why.

Direct communication eliminates the telephone game. When the person building your product is the same person you're talking to, nothing gets lost in translation. Questions get answered in minutes, not days. Decisions happen in real-time, not after committee approval.

Lower overhead means competitive pricing without sacrificing quality. I don't need to charge agency rates because I don't have agency costs. That savings goes to clients, or it goes into spending more time on the work itself.

AI tooling changes the equation entirely. Tasks that used to require junior developers—boilerplate code, documentation, testing scaffolds—now happen automatically. The work that remains is the work that actually matters: architecture decisions, business logic, edge cases, quality assurance.

## The Speed Advantage

Agencies sell process as a feature. Elaborate discovery phases. Detailed project plans. Weekly status meetings. Milestone reviews. It sounds professional, but it's mostly padding.

The dirty secret is that most of that process exists to justify billing hours, not to improve outcomes. A good developer doesn't need a two-week discovery phase to understand your landing page requirements. They need a clear brief and a few questions.

When I take on a project, work starts immediately. Not after a kickoff meeting. Not after a scope document goes through three revisions. The brief comes in, I clarify anything unclear, and building begins.

This isn't cowboy development. The brief still matters—arguably more, because there's no process to catch bad requirements later. But the process is concentrated where it adds value: at the start, in getting requirements right, and at the end, in making sure the delivery matches them.

## When Agencies Make Sense

I'm not saying agencies are always wrong. If you're a Fortune 500 company with complex compliance requirements and a procurement department that demands certain vendor characteristics, an agency might be your only option. If you need a team of twenty people for a year-long project, an agency provides that scale.

But most projects aren't like that. Most projects are a founder who needs a website, a startup that needs an MVP, a business that needs a specific integration. For those projects, a lean team delivers faster, cheaper, and often better.

## The New Model

The best way to work is simple: clear requirements, direct communication, rapid delivery, and fair pricing. No account managers filtering your requests. No project managers scheduling meetings about meetings. No junior developers padding timelines.

Just good work, delivered quickly, at a price that makes sense.
