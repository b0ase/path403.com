## The Wrong Way to Think About Kintsugi

People call Kintsugi a "startup engine" or a "contracting framework."

That's not what it is.

Kintsugi is an AI agent. Its job? Economic coordination between three parties who don't naturally trust each other.

## The Real Problem

Startups don't usually fail because the idea was bad.

They fail because:

- Agreements were vague
- Progress was impossible to measure
- Incentives drifted
- Trust broke down
- Money got released too early (or too late)

These aren't creative problems. They're coordination problems. Accounting problems.

Kintsugi turns messy human collaboration into machine-readable commitments.

## Three Parties, Three Agendas

Here's the tension:

**Founders** want momentum without losing control.

**Developers** want fair pay, clear scope, and some upside.

**Investors** want measurable delivery and limited risk.

Everyone's pulling in different directions. That's the failure mode.

Kintsugi becomes the neutral system of record. No one has to trust anyone else. They trust the system.

## How It Actually Works

Kintsugi runs a simple loop:

```
capture → negotiate → commit → meter → settle
```

Over and over. Not quarterly. Not weekly. Event by event.

It captures conversations, agreements, and changes of intent. It normalises them into structured obligations. It breaks work into discrete, verifiable deliverables. It meters progress, time, and outputs. It releases money and equity conditionally. It keeps an immutable audit trail of why things happened.

That's it.

## Everything Is a State Object

Each meaningful action becomes a state transition:

- A commitment
- A milestone
- A delivery
- A payment
- An equity release
- A dispute
- A timeout

These aren't abstract concepts. They're economic objects with ownership, history, and conditions attached.

## Why the Backend Matters

Once contracting is mediated by an agent, the backend matters more than the interface.

Kintsugi needs a ledger that is:

- Cheap enough to record everything
- Deterministic enough to enforce outcomes
- Simple enough to model state transitions
- Scalable enough for continuous micro-events

A UTXO-based system fits this naturally.

A UTXO can represent a unit of work, a claim on payment, a slice of equity, a conditional obligation, or proof that something occurred.

"Tokenisation" here has nothing to do with speculation. A UTXO already is a token: ownership + history + constraints.

## You Don't Need to Know Any of This

Participants in Kintsugi don't think about blockchains. They don't need wallets. They don't care about UTXOs.

They think in:

- Milestones
- Cash
- Equity
- Deliverables
- Accountability

Kintsugi integrates with familiar systems: Git commits, task trackers, conversation logs, AI evaluations, payment processors. Internally, those signals get normalised, committed, and settled automatically.

The economic model is boring on purpose:

- Micro-fee per captured event
- Micro-fee per state transition
- Micro-fee per settlement
- Micro-fee per audit

No single transaction matters. Frequency compounds.

## The Point

Kintsugi doesn't fix broken startups.

It turns collaboration itself into something that can be measured, enforced, and trusted — continuously, at machine speed.

Once coordination is machine-mediated, it becomes programmable.

Once it's programmable, it scales.

Once it scales, it's a business.
