We deliver production-ready features in days instead of months. This isn't marketing speak—it's a fundamental shift in how software gets built.

## Why Traditional Timelines Don't Make Sense Anymore

The old estimates made sense when humans wrote every line of code. A simple landing page took one to two weeks. An e-commerce store took two to three months. A custom dashboard took a month or two. AI integration? Three to four months minimum.

Those timelines assumed developers spending hours on boilerplate, manually wiring up components, writing repetitive code patterns they've written hundreds of times before. That assumption no longer holds.

## The New Reality

We use AI as a force multiplier. Not as a replacement for human judgment, but as a way to eliminate the tedious work that used to consume most of development time.

The AI handles component scaffolding, API route generation, database schema design, and test generation. We focus on architecture decisions, business logic, edge cases, and quality assurance—the work that actually requires human thinking.

The result is dramatically compressed timelines without sacrificing quality. A complete landing page with forms and analytics? One week. An admin dashboard with data visualization? One week. API integrations with third-party services? One week. A basic AI chat interface? Also one week.

For larger projects, we're talking two to three weeks instead of months. Full e-commerce stores with payment processing. Customer support automation systems. Content management platforms. Multi-provider AI integrations.

## How We Actually Work

Every project starts with a detailed specification. Not vague requirements or wishy-washy user stories—explicit, testable outcomes. We define exact features and user flows, technical constraints and preferences, integration requirements, and success criteria. The spec is the contract.

Development happens in rapid cycles. The traditional approach was build, review, revise, repeat—stretching over weeks or months. Our approach is build, deploy, feedback, iterate—measured in days. Staging deployments happen continuously. You see progress in real-time. Changes happen same-day.

This isn't about cutting corners. Every delivery includes full TypeScript throughout for type safety, unit and integration tests, setup guides and API documentation, and production-ready infrastructure. We ship fast because we've eliminated waste, not because we've sacrificed quality.

## The Economics

Traditional agency pricing looks something like this: discovery phase for five to ten thousand pounds, development for twenty to fifty thousand, a timeline of three to six months, and revisions charged extra. It adds up quickly, and you're locked in for half a year before seeing results.

Our model is different. We establish clear scope from day one with fixed pricing starting at £500. Delivery happens in days or weeks, not months. Revisions are included because iteration is part of the process, not an exception to it.

The math is straightforward: faster delivery, lower cost, same or better quality. We're not cheaper because we do less—we're cheaper because AI lets us do more with less time.

## What Working With Us Looks Like

When you work with us, you get full source code ownership. The code is yours forever, no licensing, no restrictions. You get production deployment, not a prototype that needs months more work to actually launch. You get documentation so your team can maintain and extend what we build. And you get thirty days of post-launch support included.

We've built customer portals in five days—user authentication with social login, dashboards with usage metrics, billing integration with Stripe, email notifications. We've shipped content agents in one week—AI-powered blog generation, SEO optimization, scheduled publishing, analytics dashboards. We've delivered trading dashboards in two weeks—real-time price feeds, portfolio tracking, trade execution, P&L reporting.

These aren't exceptional cases. They're what happens when you eliminate the waste from software development.
