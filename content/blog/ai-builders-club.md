## What is the AI Builders Club?

The AI Builders Club ($AIBC) is a token-weighted governance system for the b0ase ecosystem. Members earn tokens through contributions - building apps, fixing bugs, creating content, investing capital, or supporting the community. Those tokens grant voting rights on ecosystem decisions.

This isn't a traditional DAO with anonymous wallets voting on abstract proposals. It's a builder-first community where contributions are tracked, ranked, and rewarded with real ownership.

## The Rankings Table

Every member has a public ranking based on their contributions. The rankings table shows:

**Contribution Score:** Points earned through verified contributions
**Token Holdings:** $AIBC tokens held (earned or purchased)
**Voting Power:** Contribution score × token holdings
**Rank:** Position relative to other members

The formula is simple: **Voting Power = Contribution Score × Token Holdings**

This means you need both skin in the game (tokens) and actual contributions (score) to have meaningful governance power. Someone who buys a million tokens but never contributes has less power than an active builder with fewer tokens.

## How Contributions Are Scored

Every contribution type has a point value:

| Contribution | Points | Verification |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Ship a feature | 100-500 | Merged PR review |
| Fix a bug | 25-100 | Issue closed |
| Write documentation | 50-200 | Published and reviewed |
| Create a course | 200-500 | Published to @BO4SE |
| Onboard a new member | 50 | Member active 30 days |
| Invest capital | 1 per $10 | Transaction verified |
| Support ticket resolved | 10-25 | User confirmation |
| Content published | 25-100 | Quality review |

Points are awarded after verification. A senior member or automated system confirms the contribution before points are credited.

## Token Distribution

$AIBC tokens are distributed through multiple channels:

**Contribution Rewards:** Earn tokens proportional to your contribution score. Every 100 points = 1,000 $AIBC tokens.

**Investment:** Buy tokens directly to increase your stake. Capital invested goes into the ecosystem treasury.

**Referrals:** Earn 10% of tokens earned by members you onboard for their first year.

**Bounties:** Special projects have token bounties attached. Complete the bounty, earn the tokens.

**Airdrops:** Periodic airdrops to active members based on recent contribution activity.

## Proposing Motions

Any member with at least 1,000 $AIBC tokens can propose a motion. Motions are formal proposals for ecosystem decisions:

**Treasury Allocation:** How to spend ecosystem funds
**New Projects:** Which projects to prioritize
**Policy Changes:** Rules for contribution scoring, token distribution, etc.
**Partnerships:** Strategic partnerships and integrations
**Token Burns:** Proposals to burn tokens from treasury

To propose a motion:

1. Draft your proposal with clear objectives and rationale
2. Submit to the governance portal with a 100 $AIBC fee (prevents spam)
3. Motion enters 7-day discussion period
4. If 5 members "second" the motion, it proceeds to vote
5. 7-day voting period begins

## Voting Mechanics

Votes are weighted by voting power (contribution score × token holdings). This creates a system where:

- **Active builders with tokens** have the most influence
- **Large token holders who don't contribute** have moderate influence
- **Active contributors without tokens** have limited influence
- **Passive observers** have no influence

**Quorum:** 20% of total voting power must participate for a vote to be valid.

**Passing Threshold:** Simple majority (>50%) for standard motions. Supermajority (>66%) for constitutional changes.

**Vote Options:** Yes, No, Abstain. Abstaining counts toward quorum but not the outcome.

## The Sign-Off System

For high-stakes decisions, the AI Builders Club uses a multi-signature sign-off system. Certain actions require approval from multiple ranked members:

**Level 1 (Any 3 members):** Minor treasury expenditures (<$1,000)
**Level 2 (Top 20 members, 5 required):** Major expenditures ($1,000-$10,000)
**Level 3 (Top 10 members, 7 required):** Strategic decisions (>$10,000, partnerships)
**Level 4 (Top 5 members, unanimous):** Constitutional changes, token burns

This prevents any single member from unilaterally making major decisions while still allowing efficient operations for routine matters.

## Transparency and Accountability

Everything is public:

- **Rankings table** visible to all members
- **Contribution history** for every member
- **Vote records** showing how each member voted
- **Treasury transactions** logged on-chain
- **Motion discussions** archived permanently

Members who consistently vote against community consensus or fail to participate may lose ranking points over time. Active, engaged governance is rewarded.

## Joining the AI Builders Club

Membership is open to anyone who contributes. There's no application process - just start building:

1. **Pick a project** from the b0ase portfolio or propose your own
2. **Make a contribution** - code, content, capital, or community support
3. **Get verified** - a senior member reviews and approves your contribution
4. **Receive tokens** - $AIBC tokens are credited to your wallet
5. **Start voting** - participate in governance immediately

The barrier to entry is contribution, not capital. You can earn your way into significant voting power through pure building.

## The Long-Term Vision

The AI Builders Club is designed to scale. As the ecosystem grows:

- More projects = more contribution opportunities
- More members = more diverse perspectives
- More tokens in circulation = more distributed governance
- More treasury = more resources for builders

The goal is a self-sustaining builder economy where the people who create value also govern how that value is distributed. No venture capitalists dictating roadmaps. No anonymous whales controlling votes. Just builders building and governing together.
