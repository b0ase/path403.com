At b0ase, we build AI agents that work. Not demos. Not prototypes. Production systems that run your business while you sleep.

We've deployed autonomous agents for music labels, financial firms, e-commerce brands, and Web3 projects. This is what we've learned about building AI that actually delivers ROI.

## The Problem with "AI Tools"

Most businesses try to adopt AI and fail. They buy subscriptions to generic SaaS products, paste prompts into ChatGPT, or hire agencies that deliver PowerPoint decks instead of working systems.

The result? Months of experimentation with nothing to show for it.

**The issue isn't AI. It's architecture.**

AI agents need to be engineered into your specific workflows. They need access to your data, your tools, and your business logic. Off-the-shelf solutions can't do this.

## What We Build

**Custom AI Agents**

We design autonomous systems tailored to your operation:

- **Customer Service Agents** - Handle support tickets, answer FAQs, route complex issues to humans
- **Content Agents** - Generate, edit, and schedule content across platforms
- **Research Agents** - Monitor competitors, aggregate data, produce reports
- **Sales Agents** - Qualify leads, personalize outreach, manage follow-ups

Each agent is built specifically for your business, trained on your data, and integrated with your existing tools.

**No-Code Automation**

Not everything needs AI. We build automation workflows that eliminate manual tasks:

- Data entry and synchronization
- Invoice processing and bookkeeping
- Social media scheduling
- Email sequences and CRM updates

The goal is simple: remove every task that doesn't require human judgment.

**Full-Stack Development**

When you need custom software, we build it fast:

- **Web Applications** - Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Mobile Apps** - React Native, cross-platform
- **Dashboards** - Real-time analytics and control panels
- **APIs** - Backend services and integrations

We ship MVPs in 2-4 weeks. Production systems in 4-8 weeks.

## Our Process

**Discovery** - We map your current operations. Where does time go? What's repetitive? What requires expertise?

**Architecture** - We design the system. Which tasks get automated? Which get AI agents? Which stay human?

**Build** - We develop, test, and deploy. You get working software, not slide decks.

**Iterate** - We monitor performance and improve. AI systems get better with use.

## Why b0ase

**We're practitioners, not consultants.** We build the same systems we use to run our own projects.

**We ship fast.** No 6-month timelines. The AI landscape moves too quickly for slow development.

**We build assets, not expenses.** Custom systems accumulate value. Every improvement makes them smarter. Generic SaaS just takes monthly payments.

**We understand design.** AI that's powerful but unusable is worthless. We build interfaces that your team will actually use.
