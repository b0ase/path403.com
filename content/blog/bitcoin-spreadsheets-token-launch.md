This is what honest crypto fundraising looks like.

Not "the MVP is complete" when it isn't. Not "buy now before price goes up" pressure tactics. Not anonymous teams with no accountability.

A real company. A clear development roadmap. Investor protections built in. Milestone-based funding with refunds if we don't hit our targets.

Bitcoin Spreadsheets is raising its first development tranche. Here's exactly how it works.

## What Bitcoin Spreadsheets Will Be

Bitcoin Spreadsheets is a decentralized spreadsheet application that will store all user data on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. Your data, your keys, your spreadsheet.

**Current status: Prototype.** We have a working demo with the UI and architecture designed. The core product needs development work before it's production-ready.

**Development roadmap:**
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Functional spreadsheet with basic formulas
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): Blockchain storage integration
- **Phase 3** (Months 3-6): Testing, security audit, production hardening

We're not pretending the product is finished. We're asking you to fund its development — with clear milestones and accountability.

## The Bitcoin Corporation: A Real Company

The Bitcoin Corporation Ltd (UK Company No. 16735102) is building a suite of blockchain-native applications — bApps — that do everything Google and Microsoft do, but on Bitcoin.

This isn't an anonymous team with a Telegram group. It's a registered UK company with directors, filings, and accountability.

b0ase.com is the contractor building the product. The Bitcoin Corporation is the client offering the equity. The relationship is transparent.

## How the Crowdfunding Works

We're raising development funding in milestone-based tranches. Each tranche has:

1. **A funding threshold** — we only proceed if enough investors commit
2. **Escrow protection** — your money is held until the threshold is met
3. **Refunds if threshold not met** — if we don't hit the target, you get your money back
4. **Milestone delivery** — funds release when development work is paid for
5. **Token unlocking** — your $BSHEETS tokens unlock after milestone completion

This isn't "send money and hope." It's structured crowdfunding with investor protections.

## The Tranches

| Tranche | Raise Target | Price/Token | FDV | Milestone |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----|-----------|
| 0 | £100 | £0.00001 | £10k | Seed (✓ Complete) |
| 1 | £10,000 | £0.0001 | £100k | Functional product |
| 2 | £100,000 | £0.001 | £1M | Blockchain-enabled |
| 3 | £1,000,000 | £0.01 | £10M | Production release |

**Tranche 0** is complete — an early investor bought 1% for £100, establishing the baseline valuation.

**Tranche 1** is now open. We're raising £10,000 to fund the functional product milestone. At £0.0001 per token, that's 100 million $BSHEETS (10% of supply).

## Investment Limits and Requirements

To maintain compliance and protect investors:

**Maximum £1,000 per investor.** No whales. This keeps the investor base distributed and limits individual exposure to an early-stage project.

**KYC verification required.** You must register and verify your identity before investing. This isn't optional — it's how we stay compliant and accountable.

**2-of-2 multisig custody.** Your $BSHEETS tokens are held in a multisig wallet requiring both your signature and ours. This protects against:
- Premature selling before milestones are met
- Loss of keys (we can help recover)
- Regulatory requirements for custody

You maintain ownership. We maintain compliance. Both keys required for any transaction.

## What Happens to Your Investment

**The Bitcoin Corporation holds all investor funds in escrow.** As the company offering the equity, they manage the capital. b0ase.com is the development contractor — paid when milestones are delivered.

**If threshold is met:**
1. Your funds remain with The Bitcoin Corporation
2. The Bitcoin Corporation contracts b0ase.com for development
3. b0ase.com delivers the milestone
4. Your $BSHEETS tokens unlock in your multisig wallet

**If threshold is NOT met:**
1. The Bitcoin Corporation returns your funds in full
2. No tokens are issued
3. We reassess and potentially try again with adjusted terms

This separation matters: The Bitcoin Corporation is the investment vehicle. b0ase.com is the builder. Your money goes to the company, not directly to developers.

## The Risk/Reward Calculation

Be clear about what you're buying.

**Risks:**
- The product might not achieve product-market fit
- Development might take longer than planned
- The market might not care about decentralized spreadsheets
- Competition (Google, Microsoft) is enormous
- You could lose your entire investment

**Potential upside:**
- You're getting in at the earliest possible stage
- £10k FDV is genuinely tiny for a functional product
- If Bitcoin Spreadsheets captures even 0.1% of the $7.2B spreadsheet market, returns could be substantial
- Milestone-based funding means you're not betting on promises

**Our honest assessment:** This is a high-risk, early-stage investment. The £1,000 cap exists because we don't think anyone should bet more than they can afford to lose on an unproven product.

## The Tokenomics

**Total supply:** 1,000,000,000 $BSHEETS

**Distribution:**
- Tranche investors: Up to 51% (across all tranches)
- Development contributors: Earned through shipped code
- No pre-mine, no team allocation, no insider rounds

Tokens are earned or purchased. Nothing is granted for free.

## How to Participate

**Step 1: Register and verify KYC**
Visit b0ase.com/investors and complete identity verification. This typically takes 24-48 hours.

**Step 2: Review the terms**
Read the investment documentation. Understand the risks. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

**Step 3: Commit to Tranche 1**
Invest up to £1,000. Your funds go into escrow until the £10,000 threshold is met.

**Step 4: Wait for threshold**
If we hit £10,000, development begins. If not, you get a full refund.

**Step 5: Receive tokens**
After the functional product milestone is delivered, your $BSHEETS tokens unlock in your multisig wallet.

## Why This Model

Traditional crypto launches are broken:

- Projects raise millions on whitepapers
- Insiders get tokens at lower prices than retail
- Products launch (or don't) regardless of funding
- No accountability, no refunds, no milestones

We're trying something different:

- **Threshold funding** — we only build if there's genuine demand
- **Capped investments** — no whales, distributed ownership
- **KYC required** — real people, real accountability
- **Milestone-based** — tokens unlock when work is delivered
- **Refunds** — if we fail to raise, you get your money back

This is how crowdfunding should work. Not hype and hope. Structured funding with investor protections.

## The Bigger Picture

Bitcoin Spreadsheets is the first bApp from The Bitcoin Corporation's pipeline. The same model will apply to Bitcoin Mail, Bitcoin Drive, Bitcoin Writer, and the rest of the bApps ecosystem.

Each product. Each token. Each milestone-based crowdfunding round.

This is the factory in action — not speculation, but systematic development funded by people who believe in the mission.
