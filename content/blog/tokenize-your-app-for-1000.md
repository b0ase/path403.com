## You vibe-coded something. Now what?

You built an app over the weekend. Or maybe you've been hacking on it for months. Either way, you've got something—an idea, an MVP, maybe even something live in the app store pulling in a few dollars.

But here's where it gets messy.

Do you have customers? Real ones, not just friends who said they'd check it out. Do you have investors? Distribution? A way for people who believe in what you're building to actually back you?

And when someone asks what you're launching—is it a memecoin? Shares in a company? A token? You're not sure. You've seen people raise millions with coins that started as jokes, and you've seen serious founders get ignored because they didn't know how to play the game.

That's the moment we're in. Vibe-coins are everywhere. People are launching tokens for apps they coded in a weekend, and some of them are actually working. The line between memecoin and equity is blurring. And if you're a builder trying to figure out where you fit in all this, it's overwhelming.

That's where b0ase comes in.

## Think of b0ase as part of your team

We're your fractional CTO. Your technical co-founder who doesn't need equity negotiations or a three-month courtship. We slot in, we build, we advise—and when you don't need us anymore, we step back.

We've been in crypto since 2012—long enough to know better—and we've launched incubators and SaaS products. Most crypto people don't understand startups. Most startup people don't understand crypto. We speak both languages.

Our answer is simple: tokenize first, incorporate later.

Launch your token now. Get liquidity. Let people invest in you while you're still building. Then, when you're ready—when there's real traction, real revenue, real reasons to formalize—incorporate. You'll have capital to work with, investors who are already on board, and a clearer picture of what your company actually needs to be.

This isn't about skipping compliance. It's the opposite.

## Compliance is our edge

Here's the thing nobody tells you about launching a token: the hard part isn't the technology. It's making it legitimate.

Register of members. Cap table. Share certificates. Token issuance. Staking mechanisms. Dividend distribution. Regulatory compliance. Most founders either ignore this stuff and get burned later, or spend months drowning in legal fees trying to figure it out.

We've already figured it out.

We bridge the old world and the new—traditional company structures that lawyers and regulators understand, connected to tokens and blockchain infrastructure that actually works. By month three, you're not just launched. You're compliant. You have the paperwork. You have the technical systems. You have a framework that scales.

And it's not custom-built from scratch every time. We've built this as an off-the-shelf package that we tailor to your specific needs. You get the benefit of everything we've learned, without paying for us to learn it again.

We simplify. We strategize. We take care of you step by step.

## The deal: $999/month, 1% equity

Here's how it works.

You pay $999 a month for the first three months. Each month, you give us 1% equity—that's our skin in the game. We're not just service providers who disappear after the invoice clears. We're invested in your success, literally.

Month one, you keep 99%. Month two, 98%. Month three, 97%. You get the idea.

Want to stop after month one? Fine. You've spent $999 and given up 1%. You've still got 99% of your company and whatever we built together.

Complete all three months? You've spent $2,997 and given up 3%. By that point, you'll have a launched product, a live token, real investors, and the infrastructure to keep growing.

The point is: you're in control. No lock-ins. No three-year vesting schedules. No giving away half your company before you've shipped.

## What we actually build with you

**Month one: Launch.**
We get you live. A landing page that explains what you're doing in plain English. Your own token—real equity people can buy and trade. Email, hosting, social accounts, a logo if you need one. By the end of the month, you have something real to show people. A link you can send to anyone who asks what you're working on.

**Month two: Scale.**
Now we iterate. We help you improve the product based on what's working. We set up analytics so you can see the numbers. We build out your content—social posts, a promo video, a content calendar so you're not scrambling for what to post. We start managing your community so you're not answering Discord messages at 3am.

**Month three: Formalize.**
Time to make it official. Shareholder dashboard so you can see who owns what. KYC and compliance so you're not accidentally breaking laws. Documentation that a lawyer can read. Help with incorporation if you're ready for that step.

After that? Keep going or stop. Add specific things you need. Your call.

## Why this works

We're not replacing your accelerator or competing with your VC. We're the execution layer.

Accelerators give you mentorship, connections, and a cohort. VCs give you capital and board-level guidance. Dev shops build what you spec. But none of them sit with you month-to-month, building the actual infrastructure while you focus on product.

That's what we do. We're the team that makes the token happen, gets the landing page live, sets up the investor dashboard, and handles the stuff that isn't your core product but needs to exist.

Our 1% is only worth something if your thing becomes worth something. We only win if you win.

**Want to move faster?** You can stack months. Every $999 comes with 1%, so if you want to compress three months of work into one, pay $2,997 and give up 3% that month. We call it stacking. Some founders want to move slow and steady. Others want everything yesterday. Both work.

## Who this is for

You've vibe-coded something and you think it might have legs. But you're stuck on everything that isn't building—the business stuff, the token stuff, the "how do I actually let people invest in this" stuff.

You'd rather write code than pitch decks. The idea of doing the accelerator circuit makes you want to hide under your desk. You've seen other people launch coins and raise money and you're not sure why it's not happening for you.

You need someone who gets both worlds—crypto and startups—to help you figure out the right path and actually walk it with you.

That's us.

---

## Who this is not for

If you want us to build your idea from scratch, we're not the right fit. We help you ship what you've already started, not build your dream from a napkin sketch.

If you need enterprise compliance and regulatory approval from day one, you need different help. We're good at getting scrappy startups off the ground, not navigating Fortune 500 procurement.

If $999/month feels like too much to test whether your thing has legs, maybe you're not ready yet. That's okay. Come back when you are.

## Let's talk

Email hello@b0ase.com.

Tell us what you've built. Send a link if you have one. Explain what's working and what's not.

We'll tell you honestly whether we can help. No pitch deck required. No calls unless you want one.

Worst case, you get free feedback from a team that's seen a lot of launches. Best case, you ship.
