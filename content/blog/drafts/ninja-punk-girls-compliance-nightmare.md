This is the story of how a bank almost killed Ninja Punk Girls.

Not through malice. Not through fraud investigation. Not through any wrongdoing on our part. They just locked us out. For three months. No explanation. No recourse. No accountability.

And in those three months, Companies House sent letters threatening prosecution because we couldn't file our confirmation statement. We couldn't file because we couldn't access our bank statements. We couldn't access our bank statements because a bank with broken IT systems and no staff decided we couldn't.

This is what happens when compliance depends on gatekeepers.

## What Actually Happened

NPG's business bank account was frozen. Not flagged for suspicious activity. Not under investigation. Just frozen. The bank's systems had a problem, and we were collateral damage.

We called support. We waited on hold. We sent emails. We filed complaints. Nothing moved. The bank had no urgency because they faced no consequences. Their failure was our liability.

Meanwhile, the clock was ticking. Confirmation statements have deadlines. Companies House doesn't care about your bank's IT problems. Miss the deadline, and you're in breach. Stay in breach, and you get struck off. Get struck off, and your company ceases to exist.

Three months of limbo. Three months of legal jeopardy. Three months of depending on an institution that had every incentive to ignore us.

## The Fundamental Problem

The current system assumes banks are reliable infrastructure. They're not. They're private companies with their own priorities, their own failures, their own indifference to your compliance obligations.

But the law treats them as if they're neutral utilities. Your accounts live in their database. Your transaction history is their property. Your ability to prove your financial status depends entirely on their willingness to give you access.

This is insane.

When a single institution can put your legal status in jeopardy through sheer incompetence, the system is broken. When there's no alternative source of truth for your own financial records, the system is broken. When gatekeepers face no consequences for gatekeeping, the system is broken.

## What We're Building

Never again.

That's the principle. Whatever we build next, it has to make this situation impossible. Not unlikely. Impossible.

Here's what compliance infrastructure should look like:

**Immutable Transaction Records**

Every transaction gets written to an immutable ledger. Not instead of the bank's records — alongside them. A parallel source of truth that doesn't depend on any single institution's database.

When the bank locks you out, you still have your records. When Companies House needs verification, the data exists independently. When anyone questions your transaction history, there's a cryptographic proof that doesn't require asking permission.

**Selective Disclosure**

Companies House doesn't need to see everything. They need to verify specific facts at specific times. Annual confirmation. Director details. Registered address. Share structure.

The infrastructure should allow selective, time-limited, read-only access to exactly the data they need. No more. No less. No downloading PDFs and uploading them somewhere else. Just a cryptographic handshake that proves the relevant facts.

**Self-Sovereign Audit**

You should be able to audit your own accounts without asking anyone's permission. Bitcoin Spreadsheets — a tool we're building — lets you reconcile your records against an immutable ledger. Your books. Your verification. Your proof.

Not your bank's version of events. Your version. Cryptographically signed. Timestamped. Independently verifiable.

**Automated Compliance**

The confirmation statement process is predictable. It happens once a year. The data requirements are known in advance. There's no reason this should be a manual process that depends on human beings downloading files and filling forms.

Build the compliance logic into the backend. When the deadline approaches, the system generates the proof automatically. Companies House gets their verification. You don't have to do anything. And critically — nobody can lock you out of the process.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about NPG. This is about every small company that depends on banks to maintain their legal status. Every founder who's one IT failure away from prosecution. Every business that has no recourse when a gatekeeper decides to close the gate.

The technology to fix this exists. Immutable ledgers. Cryptographic proofs. Selective disclosure. Multi-party verification without intermediaries. It's all been built. What's missing is the adoption.

Banks won't build this. It removes their power. Regulators won't mandate it. They're comfortable with the status quo. The only people who will build it are the people who've experienced what happens when the current system fails.

We experienced it. And we're building the alternative.

## What Comes Next

NPG survived. Barely. We got access eventually. We filed eventually. We avoided prosecution eventually. But "eventually" isn't good enough when your company's existence is on the line.

The compliance tools we're building aren't just for us. They're for every company that shouldn't have to depend on a bank's IT department to maintain their legal status. Every founder who deserves a source of truth they actually control. Every business that needs infrastructure that works, not gatekeepers that might.

This is what blockchain was supposed to be. Not speculation. Not tokens. Not hype. Just reliable infrastructure for multi-party coordination without trusted intermediaries.

We're building it. Because we have to. Because nobody else will. And because what happened to NPG shouldn't happen to anyone.
