My bank locked me out of the [Ninja Punk Girls](https://ninjapunkgirls.com) company account for more than three months.

No access to my account. No access to my statements. No explanation. Just a locked door and no way to reach anyone. There was no customer-facing support phone number. Email support was limited to a generic 'hello@' address with a never-ending parade of staff whose names always changed, giving potted responses that resolved nothing. Their IT systems were broken, and nobody was accountable.

This wasn't a personal account — this was a registered UK company trying to operate. [Ninja Punk Girls](/portfolio/ninjapunkgirls-com) had customers, had revenue, had obligations. None of that mattered to the bank.

Meanwhile, Companies House sent letters. My confirmation statement was overdue. They threatened prosecution. My company's legal status was in jeopardy — not because I'd done anything wrong, but because a bank with terrible infrastructure had arbitrarily decided I couldn't access my own financial records.

This is insane. And it's 2026.

## The Absurdity of the Current System

Think about what actually happened here. A private company — my bank — became the gatekeeper to my legal compliance. Their IT failures became my legal liability. Their lack of staff became my problem. Their broken systems put my company at risk of being struck off.

I had no recourse. No alternative. No way to prove my accounts were in order because the only institution holding my records had locked me out of them.

Companies House doesn't care why you can't file. They care that you didn't file. The law doesn't distinguish between negligence and being held hostage by a bank's incompetence.

## Why Aren't My Statements on the Blockchain?

This is the question that kept running through my head during those three months. Why is my financial history locked inside a single institution's database? Why can't I access an immutable record of my own transactions?

Blockchain isn't magic. It's just a shared ledger that nobody controls. An immutable data layer. A compliance rail that doesn't depend on any single institution's IT department being functional.

If my bank statements existed on a blockchain by default, I could access them regardless of whether my bank's systems were working. I could prove my transactions without asking permission. I could file my compliance documents without depending on a gatekeeper.

## Why Doesn't Companies House Have Selective Access?

Here's another obvious question: why does the annual confirmation statement process depend on me downloading PDFs from my bank and uploading them somewhere else?

Companies House needs to verify that my accounts are in order once a year. That's it. They don't need ongoing access to my transactions. They need a single, verifiable snapshot at compliance time.

If my financial records lived on an immutable ledger, Companies House could have selective, time-limited, read-only access to the specific data they need. No intermediaries. No PDFs. No depending on banks to not lock me out at the worst possible moment.

This is basic multi-party coordination. Two organisations that need to verify information about a third party, without either of them fully trusting the other. This is exactly the problem blockchain infrastructure was designed to solve.

## The Real Problem Is Gatekeeping

Banks have become gatekeepers to our own data. Not because they're malicious, but because the system was designed in an era when centralised institutions were the only way to maintain trusted records.

That era is over.

We have the technology for immutable, distributed ledgers. We have the cryptographic tools for selective disclosure. We have the infrastructure for multi-party verification without intermediaries.

What we don't have is the will to use them.

Banks don't want to give up control. Regulators don't want to change processes. And individuals like me get caught in the middle — prosecuted for non-compliance because a gatekeeper decided to lock the gate.

## What Should Exist

Imagine a tool — [Bitcoin Spreadsheets](/portfolio/bitcoin-spreadsheets) — that lets you audit your own accounts against an immutable record. Not a bank's record. Your record. Cryptographically signed, timestamped, verifiable.

Imagine Companies House having a simple API that requests a compliance snapshot once a year, verified against that immutable record. No downloads. No uploads. No PDFs. Just a cryptographic proof that your accounts are in order.

Imagine not depending on a bank's IT department to maintain your legal status as a company director.

This isn't science fiction. The technology exists. The infrastructure exists. What's missing is the adoption — and the recognition that the current system is fundamentally broken.

## The Boring Infrastructure Thesis

I've written before about blockchain as boring infrastructure. Not a speculative asset. Not a get-rich-quick scheme. Just plumbing that works.

This is what boring infrastructure looks like in practice. It's not exciting. It doesn't make headlines. It just prevents situations where a bank's three-month IT failure puts you at risk of prosecution.

Reliable. Predictable. Always accessible. That's what financial infrastructure should be. That's what it could be, if we stopped treating blockchain as a speculative toy and started treating it as the compliance layer it was designed to be.

## The Question Nobody Wants to Answer

Why are we still suffering banks gatekeeping our accounts?

I don't have a good answer. Neither does anyone else. The technology to fix this exists. The use case is obvious. The current system is demonstrably broken.

And yet here we are, in 2026, still dependent on institutions that can lock us out of our own records and face no consequences when their failures become our legal liability.

Something has to change. And it won't be the banks who change it.

## Be Part of the Solution

We're not waiting for permission. [Bitcoin Spreadsheets](/portfolio/bitcoin-spreadsheets) is being built right now — a tool that puts your financial records on an immutable ledger, gives you cryptographic proof of every transaction, and lets you share compliance snapshots with anyone who needs them.

No bank can lock you out of your own blockchain records.

**[Invest in Bitcoin Spreadsheets](/portfolio/bitcoin-spreadsheets)** — tokens start at just one penny. Help us build the infrastructure that should have existed decades ago.
