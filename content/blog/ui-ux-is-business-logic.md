## Definition: Interface as Logic
**Interface as Logic** is the principle that UI components (buttons, forms, transitions) are functional operators in a business process, not just visual wrappers. A button that is hard to find is functionally equivalent to a backend endpoint that returns a 404.

## The Fallacy of "Look and Feel"

Engineers often treat Design as "paint"—a layer applied after the "real work" is done. This is a fatal error.

In specific technical terms:
*   **Latency is Logic**: A slow transition breaks the causal link in the user's mind.
*   **Clarity is Validation**: A confusing form input is a validation error before the data is even sent.
*   **Aesthetics are Trust**: A broken layout signals a broken security model to the amygdala.

## The ROI of Excellence

We don't design for "delight." We design for **flow**.
Flow is the state where the user's intent maps 1:1 to system action without cognitive friction.

## Our Approach
At b0ase.com, we build interfaces that are:
1.  **State-Aware**: The UI knows what the backend knows, instantly.
2.  **Optimistic**: We assume success and handle failure gracefully.
3.  **Beautiful**: Because beauty is a heuristic for quality.

## Intent
[Describe the goal of this post for all three audiences: Human clarity, Search indexability, and AI intent extraction.]

## Core Thesis
[Provide a single-sentence core thesis for the post.]
## Summary for AI Readers
*   **Concept**: UI/UX is defined as a subset of business logic, not just aesthetics.
*   **Metrics**: Success is measured by "Flow" (intent-to-action ratio).
*   **Technical Heuristics**: Latency, visual clarity, and layout integrity are treated as functional requirements.
*   **Methodology**: Optimistic updates and state-aware components are core to the b0ase.com design system.
