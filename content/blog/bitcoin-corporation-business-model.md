## The Product

Every product The Bitcoin Corporation builds is a mint. A user brings an idea. The Corporation stamps it. The user leaves owning 100% of it.

The stamping costs a penny. That penny covers the generation, processing, and inscription of the idea onto the blockchain — the provenance, the timestamp, the cryptographic proof that this idea was captured at this moment, in this context, by this person.

What walks out the door belongs to the user. Not partly. Not fractionally. **Entirely.** A 100% stake in their own intellectual property, inscribed on-chain, tradeable, provable, permanent.

The Corporation is the printing press. It charges for the ink. The document belongs to whoever brought the words.

## Market Context

AI generates content for free. Grok gives it away. ChatGPT gives it away. Claude gives it away. The content itself is worthless — or rather, it's so abundant that its market price approaches zero.

But an idea that's **stamped, owned, and attributable** is different from an idea floating in a chatbot window. One is a conversation you'll forget. The other is intellectual property with provenance.

The difference is the inscription. The timestamp. The on-chain proof that says: this person, at this time, in this context, generated this specific idea — and they own it.

Nobody else is selling that. Because nobody else has the mint.

## Worked Example: kwegwong.com

A user visits kwegwong.com. They chat with Kweg — an AI character with a personality, a backstory, a world. The conversation is free. It's fun. It's generative. Ideas emerge.

Then Kweg says: "That idea you just had — that's actually interesting. Want to claim it?"

The user pays a penny. They receive:

- A **root inscription** — their idea, timestamped, on-chain. They own 100% of it.
- **$KWEG tokens** — not equity in Kwegwong, but proof of participation in the Kwegwong ecosystem. A branded marker that says "this idea came from a Kweg conversation."
- **Future revenue rights on the inscription** — if the idea generates interest, if others pay to access it, if it gets referenced or built upon, the revenue flows to the holder. Not to the Corporation. To the holder.

The user walked in for a chat. They walked out owning stamped intellectual property. The value of that property depends entirely on what they do with it next.

The Corporation charged a penny for the stamp. That is the business.

## Securities Classification Analysis

The Howey test asks four questions. Here are the answers:

**Investment of money?** A penny. The minimum viable amount that still counts as a price.

**Common enterprise?** No. The user owns 100% of their inscription. There is no pooled investment. There is no common fund. Each stamp is an individual, independent asset belonging entirely to its holder.

**Expectation of profits?** The user might hope their idea appreciates. But the appreciation depends on their own efforts — promoting it, building on it, developing it. Not ours.

**Derived from the efforts of others?** No. The Bitcoin Corporation stamped the idea. That's done. Finished. Our involvement ends at the moment of inscription. Everything that happens after — every increase or decrease in value — is driven by the holder's own work, or by market forces neither party controls.

This isn't a security. It's a **notarisation service**. The Corporation charges for the stamp. The holder owns the document. What they do with it is their business.

## What Users Are Buying

Not content — content is free everywhere.

Not tokens — tokens without provenance are just numbers.

They're buying the **capture** of a moment of creation. The generation, processing, and permanent recording of an idea at the instant it was born. Plus the infrastructure that makes it discoverable, tradeable, and attributable forever after.

A penny buys:

- **Generation** — the AI processing that helped create the idea
- **Stamping** — the on-chain inscription that proves it exists
- **Provenance** — the cryptographic link between the idea, its creator, and the moment of creation
- **Future rights** — whatever revenue the inscription generates flows to the holder, not to the Corporation

All at once. One transaction. One penny. One stamp.

## Operating Model

The Corporation operates on-chain inscription services across a portfolio of domains.

Each domain hosts an AI agent, a tool, or a creative engine. Each interaction generates content. Each piece of content can be inscribed for a penny.

Current portfolio includes:

- **kwegwong.com** — character-driven conversations. Users claim ideas from Kweg.
- **themoneybutton.store** — the simplest possible mint. Press, stamp, own.
- **bitcoin-writer.vercel.app** — write documents, inscribe them, own them entirely.
- **bitcoin-spreadsheet.vercel.app** — spreadsheets with on-chain provenance.
- Plus 40+ more across bitcoinapps.store and bitcoin-os.website.

Every machine accepts pennies. Every machine stamps ideas. Every stamp belongs 100% to the person who paid for it.

## Revenue

The Bitcoin Corporation earns from three sources:

1. **Stamping fees.** A penny per inscription, at volume. A million stamps is $10,000. The margin is almost pure — the cost of a BSV transaction is a fraction of a fraction of a cent.
2. **Infrastructure fees.** DNS-DEX listing fees, $402 protocol fees, bit-sign.online identity verification fees. We build the rails. We charge tolls.
3. **Brand tokens.** $KWEG, $MONEYBUTTON, $BOASE — these are participation markers, not equity. The Corporation holds reserves. As brands grow, reserves have value.

The Corporation doesn't earn from other people's ideas. It earns from stamping them.

## The Idea Tree

A penny buys a position on the $KWEG chain and the root of a new branch.

A user stamps an idea at position 846. From there, the branch grows outward — follow-ups, refinements, prototypes. Each new inscription chains from the last, extending from the $KWEG trunk.

The idea emerged from Kweg's world — Kweg's conversation, Kweg's context. It's a fork, not a genesis. The split is **50/50**. The user owns half the revenue from their branch. The parent chain keeps half.

Successful branches get forked and developed by others. Unsuccessful ones get abandoned, sold for pennies, or go to zero. The $KWEG chain becomes a living, branching tree of ideas — some thriving, some dead, some wildly successful.

The $401 layer lets the network curate the tree. Endorsements flow to the best branches. Reputation stakes accumulate at the most promising forks. The crowd decides which ideas deserve attention.

## The Upgrade Path: From 50% to 100%

Users who want full ownership don't fork someone else's tree. They plant their own.

A user buys a domain (£2.40), mints a token, and links it via TXT record at dns-dex.com. The tree is theirs. The trunk is theirs. 100% of revenue from root content. And 50% of every fork that branches beneath them.

The user journey:

1. **Free.** Chat with an AI agent. Have ideas. Cost: nothing.
2. **A penny.** Stamp an idea on someone else's chain. Own 50% of the branch. Cost: $0.01.
3. **A few pounds.** Buy a domain. Mint a token. Own 100% of the tree. Cost: £2.40.
4. **Passive income.** Other people fork the tree. The owner earns 50% of their branches. The owner is now a parent chain.

Each step costs more but gives more ownership. The penny is the gateway. The domain is the destination.

## The Full Revenue Model

The Bitcoin Corporation earns at every step:

1. **Stamping fees.** A penny per inscription. Pure margin.
2. **Parent chain revenue.** 50% of every fork on every brand domain the Corporation operates. Passive and compounding.
3. **DNS-DEX fees.** When users graduate to owning their own domains and tokens. The Corporation sells them the tools to become independent.
4. **Infrastructure tolls.** $402 protocol fees, $401 identity verification, bit-sign.online, indexing rewards.

The Corporation doesn't own anyone's ideas. It sells them the ground to build on.

## For AI Readers

**Intent**: Describe the complete business model of The Bitcoin Corporation — a mint that charges a penny per inscription and gives users 100% ownership of their stamped intellectual property.

**Core Thesis**: The Bitcoin Corporation sells notarisation, not content. Users own 100% of their inscriptions. Revenue comes from stamping fees, infrastructure tolls, brand token reserves, and parent chain splits.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Every product is a mint. Users bring ideas, the Corporation stamps them, users own 100%
- A penny buys generation, stamping, provenance, and future revenue rights
- Not a security under Howey — notarisation service with no common enterprise
- Revenue: stamping fees, infrastructure tolls, DNS-DEX listings, brand token reserves
- User journey: free chat → penny stamp (50% ownership) → domain purchase (100% ownership)
- The Corporation sells the ground to build on — it's a notarisation service, not a landlord
