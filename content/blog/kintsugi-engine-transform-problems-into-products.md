You have an idea. Maybe it's been rattling around in your head for months. Maybe someone told you "that should be an app" and you agreed.

The problem isn't the idea. It's everything else. Building a company is hard. You need capital, investors who believe in you, a way to track who owns what, and the infrastructure to make it all legal — before you even know if the idea will work.

We built the Kintsugi Engine to solve all of that for £999.

## What Is Kintsugi?

Kintsugi is a startup in a box. You describe your idea to our AI architect. We give you everything you need to raise capital and build a product.

For £999, you get:

- **100% equity** in your project from day one
- **Cap table and registry** — track who owns what, on-chain
- **Shares as tokens** — your equity tracked on the blockchain of your choice
- **2-of-3 multi-sig custody** — you control all transfers
- **Marketing website** with domain hosting
- **Social media accounts** with automation
- **KYC integration** so you can raise capital legally

That's the whole startup infrastructure. Pre-incorporation. Ready to pitch investors.

## How It Works

**Step 1: Pay £999**

One payment. You own 100% of your idea from day one. b0ase earns equity later — through delivered work.

**Step 2: Get Your Startup Kit**

We set up your cap table, create your share registry on-chain, configure your multi-sig wallet, build your landing page, connect your social media, and integrate KYC. You choose which blockchain to use.

You now have real pre-incorporation infrastructure. Something you can show investors — without the legal fees of forming a company first.

**Step 3: Raise Capital**

This is the key part. Your shares are tracked on-chain as tokens — real equity in your idea. You can sell them to anyone: friends, family, believers.

The 2-of-3 multi-sig means you control all transfers. No one can move shares without your approval. You decide who gets equity and at what price.

KYC integration (we use Veriff — same as banks) means your investors are verified. You're raising capital legally, with a proper cap table, before you've even incorporated.

**Step 4: Fund Development**

Use the capital you've raised to pay for development. £999/month — flat rate, no escalation. Each payment releases 1% equity to b0ase for the previous month's work.

Infrastructure costs (hosting, APIs, services) are billed separately at cost. Fully transparent.

Your friends aren't just investing in an idea. They're funding actual development. They can watch progress on GitHub.

## Why This Model?

Traditional paths to building a startup are broken:

**VC funding** means giving up control. Dilution. Board seats. Someone else's vision for your company.

**Bootstrapping** means you need savings or a job that pays enough to fund side projects. Most people don't have this luxury.

**Crowdfunding platforms** take huge fees and give you customers, not equity investors.

Kintsugi fixes all three:

**You keep control** — 2-of-3 multi-sig means no one moves shares without you. 100% equity from day one means you own your company.

**You don't need savings** — Pay £999 to get set up, then raise capital from your network. Your friends and family become your seed round.

**It's real equity** — Shares tracked on-chain. Proper cap table and registry. KYC-verified investors. Not presales or rewards.

**No premature incorporation** — Test your idea before committing to legal entity costs. If it works, you have all the infrastructure ready to incorporate. If it doesn't, you haven't wasted thousands on lawyers.

## The Economics

Let's say you raise £10,000 from 10 friends at £1,000 each.

That covers 10 months of development. You've now got a working product without spending your own money beyond the initial £999.

Your friends each own a piece of your company. They're aligned with your success. They'll share your posts, make intros, and root for you.

If the product takes off, their shares are worth something. If it doesn't, everyone knew the risk.

## What We Build

Anything software. Our AI architect helps you define what makes sense:

- Internal tools that should exist but don't
- Consumer apps your friends would use
- Automation systems that save time
- Data products built on proprietary knowledge
- Blockchain applications
- AI-powered tools

The conversation shapes the product. By the time you pay, you know exactly what you're getting.

**[View the development roadmap](/kintsugi/roadmap)** — see exactly what you get each month.

**[Describe your idea](/kintsugi)** — talk to our AI architect. No payment required.

No commitment yet. Just a conversation about what you want to build. If there's a product here, you'll see a proposal with everything: token symbol, website mockup, development roadmap, pricing breakdown.

Then decide if you want to make it real.
