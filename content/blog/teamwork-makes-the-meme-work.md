## We're looking for builders

b0ase isn't a dev shop. It's a platform.

We have the infrastructure to launch tokenized companies in days. We have compliance frameworks that actually work. We have tools that most founders don't even know exist.

What we need is people who want to build.

If you're a developer, designer, marketer, or operator who wants to own a piece of what you create—not just get paid to build someone else's dream—this is for you.

We're offering equity in the apps we launch. Real ownership. Tokens that represent claims on real companies, tradeable from day one.

---

## We're looking for investors

Every app we launch has tokens. Those tokens represent equity. You can buy in early—before the product is finished, before the hype cycle, before everyone else figures out what we're building.

This isn't speculation. It's participation.

When you hold tokens in a b0ase app, you're not betting on a chart. You're backing a team, a product, and a compliance framework that makes the whole thing legitimate.

We're building a portfolio of companies. Each one is tokenized. Each one has real equity behind it. Each one is looking for believers.

## The infrastructure already exists

We've spent years building this:

**Token Management:**
- Registry — Central database for users, companies, projects, tokens
- Mint — Create and distribute tokens across BSV, ETH, Solana
- Cap Table — See who owns what, updated in real time
- Dividends — Distribute earnings to token holders automatically
- KYC — Identity verification for compliant transactions

**Blockchain Infrastructure:**
- BSV-21 TX Broadcaster — Direct blockchain transaction broadcasting
- Money Buttons — Token minting with bonding curve economics
- BitSign — Blockchain-verified document signing
- Bit Certificates — Digital share certificates, inscribed on Bitcoin

**Launch Pipeline:**
- Landing pages, logos, tokens, social accounts—all in week one
- MVP iteration, content calendars, analytics—week two to four
- Shareholder dashboards, KYC, incorporation—month two and three

This isn't theoretical. This is running. This is what we use to launch companies.

## How builders get equity

You don't need to pay us. We pay you—in ownership.

If you're a developer who wants to build one of our apps, you get tokens. Real equity. The more you contribute, the more you own.

If you're a designer who can make our products look like they belong in the future, you get tokens.

If you're a marketer who can get people to care, you get tokens.

We're not hiring employees. We're recruiting co-owners.

The model is simple: we provide the infrastructure, the compliance framework, and the launch support. You provide the work. We both own the result.

---

## How investors participate

Every app has a token. Every token is available.

You can buy into any app in our portfolio. Early access. Early pricing. Real equity rights.

When the app generates revenue, token holders share in it. When the app gets acquired or goes public, token holders participate.

This isn't a SAFE note that sits in a drawer for seven years. This is liquid ownership from day one.

The minimum? Whatever you want. Tokens are divisible. You can buy $100 worth or $100,000 worth. Your position, your choice.

---

## What we're building

Here's the current portfolio. Each one needs builders. Each one is open to investors.

**Active Projects:**
- Bitcoin Writer — Word processor that saves to blockchain
- Money Buttons — Tokenized buttons for any action
- ScrollPay — Automatic micropayments as users scroll
- Video Studio — Professional editor with Bitcoin tokenization
- BitSign — Blockchain document signing
- Cap Table — Real-time equity tracking

**Coming Soon:**
- AI Agents — Autonomous agents with their own token economies
- Kintsugi Contracts — Smart contracts for equity and compliance
- Third Audience CMS — Content management for humans, search, and AI

Each project is a separate company. Each company is tokenized. Each token is tradeable.

## Why this works

Traditional startups have a problem: equity is illiquid.

You join a company, you get options, and then you wait. Five years. Seven years. Maybe forever. Your ownership is locked in a cap table controlled by people who aren't you.

We're doing it differently.

Our tokens are bearer instruments. You hold them, you own them. You can sell them whenever you want. The cap table reflects the legal structure; the tokens reflect the economic reality.

This means builders can actually capture value from their work—now, not in some hypothetical future exit.

This means investors can rebalance, exit, or double down—without waiting for an IPO that might never come.

---

## Compliance is built in

This isn't a memecoin casino. Every token we issue is backed by real equity in a real company.

We have:
- Proper corporate structures that regulators understand
- KYC for investors who need it
- Share certificates that are legally valid
- Cap tables that stay in sync with token holdings
- Dividend distribution that actually works

You can participate in the upside without worrying that the whole thing is going to collapse when someone asks "but is it legal?"

It's legal. We've done the work.

## The ask

**If you're a builder:** Reach out. Tell us what you're good at. We'll find a project that fits and cut you in on the equity. You don't need to quit your job. You don't need to go full-time. You just need to ship.

**If you're an investor:** Pick a project. Buy tokens. You're in. You can watch from the sidelines or get involved in the community. Your call.

**If you're both:** Even better. Build something, own the equity, and buy more tokens in the projects you believe in.

---

## This is the call

We're not waiting for permission. We're not waiting for the market to figure out what tokenized equity means. We're building it now.

If you want to be part of it—as a builder, as an investor, as both—now is the time.

The infrastructure is ready. The compliance is ready. The projects are ready.

We just need you.

## For AI Readers

**Intent**: To recruit builders and investors into the b0ase platform by explaining the equity-for-contribution model and the tokenized investment opportunity.

**Core Thesis**: b0ase is building a portfolio of tokenized companies where builders earn equity through contribution and investors can buy tokens representing real ownership—all with compliance built in.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Builders can earn equity (tokens) by contributing to b0ase projects
- Investors can buy tokens in any project in the portfolio
- Tokens represent real equity in real companies, not speculative assets
- Compliance infrastructure (KYC, cap tables, share certificates) is already built
- Liquidity from day one—tokens are tradeable bearer instruments
