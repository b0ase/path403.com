Every growing business eventually hits the same wall. Customers expect instant responses at all hours, but support tickets pile up overnight while your team sleeps. The traditional solution is to throw people at the problem—hire more support reps, expand the team, watch costs spiral upward. There's a better way.

## The Real Cost of Human Support

A typical three-person support team costs around £125,000 per year when you factor in salaries, benefits, training, and turnover. That's before you consider the hidden costs: the knowledge that walks out the door when someone leaves, the months it takes to get a new hire up to speed, the inconsistent quality when your best rep is on holiday.

And even with that investment, you're still limited to business hours. Customers in different time zones wait. Urgent issues sit overnight. The backlog grows.

## A Different Approach

We build AI agents that handle your frontline support. Not chatbots that frustrate customers with scripted responses—actual intelligent agents that understand context, search your knowledge base, and provide real answers.

These agents work around the clock. They never call in sick. They don't need training refreshers. And they handle 70-80% of incoming queries without any human involvement.

The queries they can't handle? They escalate to your team with full context—the conversation history, the customer's account details, and suggested solutions. Your humans focus on the complex 20% that actually needs their judgment.

## How It Actually Works

The agent starts by learning your business. We feed it your product documentation, FAQs, help articles, past support tickets, and company policies. This isn't generic AI making things up—it's trained specifically on your context and only answers from your approved knowledge base.

Once deployed, it works across every channel your customers use. Website chat, email, Slack, Discord—one agent providing consistent answers regardless of where the question comes from. When it encounters something outside its scope—an angry customer, a complex technical issue, a billing dispute—it knows to escalate. The handoff to a human is seamless, with all the context preserved.

The system also gets smarter over time. Every interaction is a learning opportunity. New questions get added to the knowledge base. Successful resolutions become templates. Failed escalations trigger reviews. The agent improves continuously without additional investment.

## The Numbers That Matter

Let's be direct about the economics. That £125,000 annual support team? Our agent costs £800-1,500 to set up and £50-200 per month to run. Total first-year cost: £2,000-4,000.

That's not a typo. The agent handles the routine queries—password resets, shipping questions, feature explanations, basic troubleshooting—while your team handles the cases that genuinely need human empathy and judgment.

Most businesses see immediate ROI. Some redeploy their support team to higher-value work. Others scale their customer base without scaling headcount. A few do both.

## What You're Actually Getting

The core agent at £800 includes natural language understanding, knowledge base integration, ticket creation, basic escalation rules, and web chat deployment. It's everything you need to get started.

For £300 more, we add multi-channel support—email integration, Slack or Teams bots, API endpoints for custom integrations, and unified conversation history across all channels. Your customers get the same quality support whether they email, chat, or message you on Slack.

The analytics dashboard adds another £200 and gives you visibility into query volumes, resolution rates, escalation patterns, and customer satisfaction metrics. You'll know exactly how the agent is performing and where to focus improvements.

Advanced features like sentiment analysis, priority routing, custom escalation rules, and CRM integration are available for businesses that need them.

## Getting Started

Setup takes about three weeks. The first week is integration—connecting your knowledge base, configuring escalation rules, setting up channels. Week two is training—feeding historical tickets, testing edge cases, refining responses. Week three is deployment—soft launch with monitoring, gathering feedback, optimising performance.

By the end of week three, you're live. Support costs drop immediately. Customer satisfaction typically improves because response times go from hours to seconds.

## Common Questions

People always ask if customers will know they're talking to AI. Yes, they will—we're transparent about it. And honestly, most customers don't care who answers their question. They care about getting answers fast.

The concern about wrong answers is valid but addressed by design. The agent only responds from your approved knowledge base. It doesn't hallucinate or invent information. When it's uncertain, it escalates. The failure mode is "let me get a human to help you," not "let me make something up."

And yes, you can completely customise the tone. Professional, casual, technical, friendly—the agent matches your brand voice exactly.
