The Japanese art of **Kintsugi** (金継ぎ) teaches us that there is beauty in the broken. By repairing a shattered bowl with gold, the resulting piece becomes stronger and more valuable than the original.

At b0ase.com, we have a portfolio of "Concept" and "Demo" applications—projects that were built to prove a production-ready apps and businesses.

Today, we are opening the Kintsugi Contract Program.

## Kintsugi Contract: All Projects Eligible

This isn't limited to a handful of specific apps. **Every single project** on b0ase.com—from experimental "Concept" apps to functional "Demo" codebases—falls within the scope of the **Kintsugi Contracting Engine**.

Whether it's the decentralized utility of **Bitcoin Drive**, the futuristic fashion of **Miss Void**, or the sustainable infrastructure of **Osinka Kalaso**, the entire portfolio is waiting for a "Kintsugi Contract."

These aren't just ideas; they are working codebases waiting for the right hands to turn them into production-ready empires.

## Two Ways to Contract

You don't need a massive team to turn these into realities. You just need the **Kintsugi Engine** and a commitment.

## The Developer Contract

Are you a "Vibe-Coder" who knows how to move mountains with AI? Choose a project, define the necessary work (build, fix, or scale), and contract to deliver it. 

In return for your delivered code, you earn **both money and equity**, with terms established through negotiation and agreed upon by investors and developers.

## The Investor Contract

Don't have the time to code, but have the vision to see where these apps are going? You can contract to fund the repair. Investors offer **dynamic amounts of investment capital** for **varying amounts of work**, funding development tranches required to bring the app to market.

As the funder, you earn an agreed-upon **slice of equity** as the work is completed and released.

## The Goal: 100% Alignment

The Kintsugi Model ensures that everyone wins. b0ase.com provides the infrastructure and the starting codebase. Developers provide the execution. Investors provide the capital. 

Equity is earned based on **delivered work**, as defined and agreed upon within each contract.

Whether you're repairing a broken workflow or building the next great Bitcoin application, the goal is the same: to turn precious scars into golden products.

**Which project will you repair first?**
