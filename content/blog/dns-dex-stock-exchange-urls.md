How a TXT record, a token, and a 51% vote turn any domain name into a publicly traded company.

-----

## The Simplest Idea in This Entire Series

Every business has a domain name. Every domain name has an owner. What if owning part of the domain meant owning part of the business?

Not metaphorically. Not through a legal agreement filed in a drawer. Not through a smart contract on a chain nobody uses. Literally: the domain's DNS record points to a public wallet address. Tokens at that address represent shares. Token holders receive revenue. And at 51%, they control the domain itself.

That's DNS-DEX. A stock exchange where the ticker symbols are URLs.

-----

## How It Works

DNS already supports TXT records -- arbitrary text strings attached to a domain. They're used for email verification, SSL certificates, and site ownership proofs. Google uses them. Microsoft uses them. Every registrar supports them.

You add one line:

```
b0ase.com  TXT  "bsv:1A3x7Bf2k9..."
```

That's it. The domain now has a publicly verifiable link to a BSV wallet address. Anyone can look up the TXT record. Anyone can verify: this domain is controlled by this wallet. The anchor is set.

No new infrastructure. No special protocol. No permission from ICANN. Just a TXT record that every DNS system in the world already knows how to serve.

-----

## The Token

At that wallet address, you mint tokens. These are $402 tokens -- fungible, tradeable, representing fractional ownership of the domain's economic output.

b0ase.com mints 1,000,000 $B0ASE tokens. Each one represents one-millionth of the revenue generated by everything that happens at b0ase.com -- content sales, API access, $402 payments, whatever the domain earns.

The tokens are listed on DNS-DEX. Anyone can buy them. The price is set by the market -- by supply and demand among people who believe (or don't believe) that b0ase.com will generate revenue.

-----

## Revenue Routing

Every $402 payment that flows through the domain is automatically split. A percentage goes to the operator (the person running the site, paying for hosting, creating the content). The rest flows to token holders proportionally.

If b0ase.com earns 10 BSV this month and the split is 60/40, the operator gets 6 BSV and 4 BSV is distributed across all token holders. If you hold 1% of the tokens, you get 0.04 BSV. Automatically. On-chain. No invoicing. No payment processing. Just satoshis arriving in your wallet.

-----

## Governance

Here's where it gets radical.

At 51% of tokens, the holders control the domain. Not advisory control. Not "governance proposals" that the founder can ignore. Actual control. The DNS record itself can be updated by a threshold signature from majority token holders.

This means:

- **51% can change where the domain points.** Don't like the current operator? Vote to redirect the domain to a new server.
- **51% can change the revenue split.** Operator taking too much? Vote to adjust.
- **51% can hire and fire.** The operator serves at the pleasure of the shareholders. Just like a CEO serves at the pleasure of the board.

The domain name isn't owned by a person anymore. It's owned by a market. The TXT record is the share certificate. The wallet address is the cap table. The 51% threshold is the boardroom.

-----

## What Gets Listed

Every domain is a potential listing. But the interesting ones are the ones that actually do something -- that serve content, run APIs, generate revenue.

A few examples from the b0ase.com portfolio:

**[path402.com](https://path402.com)** -- the $402 protocol client. Revenue from protocol fees, token sales, and premium features. Token holders own a share of the protocol's economic activity.

**[path401.com](https://path401.com)** -- the $401 identity standard. Revenue from verification services, enterprise integrations, and identity infrastructure. Early stage, low revenue, cheap tokens -- high risk, high potential return.

**path403.com** -- the $403 access control standard. Not yet built. Tokens are pure speculation on future utility. The cheapest entry point.

**[bit-sign.online](https://bit-sign.online)** -- the identity signing tool. Revenue from signing service fees. Functional today. Demonstrable usage.

**[dns-dex.com](https://dns-dex.com)** -- the exchange itself. Revenue from listing fees, trading fees, and the spread on token purchases. The meta-play: the exchange is listed on itself.

Each domain is a micro-company. Each micro-company has its own token. Each token is listed on DNS-DEX. The exchange is the marketplace for every URL that wants to be publicly traded.

-----

## The Directory and the API

At each tokenised domain, you publish two things.

**A directory** -- human-readable. Visit the URL, see what's there. Browse the content, read the documentation, understand the offering. This is the shopfront.

**An API** -- machine-readable. Hit the endpoint, get structured data back. Let agents interact programmatically. Let other systems integrate. This is the back office.

The directory and the API serve the same data in different formats. One is for humans scrolling. The other is for bots building. Both are gated by $402 (payment) and optionally by $401 (identity) and $403 (permission).

A tokenised domain isn't just a website anymore. It's a **programmable economic endpoint** -- a URL that serves content, accepts payments, distributes revenue, and responds to both human and machine queries.

-----

## Why TXT Records

People will ask: why DNS? Why not just put everything on-chain?

Because DNS is the internet's existing namespace. It's universal. It's understood. It's supported by every device, every browser, every operating system on the planet. Building on DNS means building on infrastructure that already works, at scale, everywhere.

The TXT record is the bridge. It connects the existing namespace (DNS) to the new economic layer (BSV tokens). You don't have to replace DNS. You don't have to convince anyone to adopt a new naming system. You just add a single line to a record that already exists.

And TXT records are verifiable by anyone. No special software. No blockchain node. Just a DNS lookup. Run `dig b0ase.com TXT` and you'll see the wallet address. Run it from anywhere in the world. It's the same answer every time.

The domain registrar doesn't need to know what you're doing. They don't need to support blockchain. They don't need to integrate with anything. You're using their system exactly as it was designed -- to publish arbitrary text records associated with a domain. The fact that your text record happens to point to a BSV wallet is none of their business.

-----

## The Micro-Company Economy

Here's what this creates at scale.

Right now, starting a company means: incorporate, open a bank account, find investors, issue shares through a lawyer, maintain a share register, file annual accounts, deal with Companies House. It takes months and costs thousands.

On DNS-DEX, starting a company means: buy a domain (£2.40), add a TXT record (free), mint tokens (fraction of a penny), list on the exchange (transaction fee). It takes minutes and costs almost nothing.

The company IS the domain. The share register IS the wallet. The annual accounts ARE the on-chain transaction history. The board meeting IS the 51% threshold vote.

Every side project, every blog, every tool, every experiment -- if it has a domain, it can be a company. Not a pretend company. A real economic entity with real shareholders, real revenue, and real governance.

The friction of company formation has been, historically, the biggest barrier to entrepreneurship. You need a certain scale to justify the overhead. Nobody incorporates a weekend project. Nobody issues shares for a blog.

DNS-DEX eliminates that friction. The blog IS a company. The weekend project IS a company. The domain IS the incorporation.

-----

## The Self-Listing Exchange

DNS-DEX itself is listed on DNS-DEX.

dns-dex.com has a TXT record pointing to a wallet. $DNSDEX tokens are minted at that wallet. Revenue from exchange operations -- listing fees, trading fees, premium features -- flows to token holders.

This is important because it means the exchange has the same governance properties as everything listed on it. If the community doesn't like how the exchange is being run, 51% can redirect the domain. The exchange operator serves the shareholders, not the other way around.

No exchange in history has been structured this way. Coinbase serves its shareholders, but its shareholders can't redirect coinbase.com. The NYSE serves its members, but its members can't vote to change the exchange's DNS records.

DNS-DEX can be captured by its own community at any time. That's not a vulnerability. It's the feature. The exchange that can be seized by its users is the exchange that has to serve its users.

-----

## The 60-Domain Portfolio

Consider a venture studio with 60 projects. Each project has a domain. Each domain is tokenised. Each token is listed on DNS-DEX.

An investor looks at the portfolio and sees 60 micro-companies, each with visible on-chain revenue, transparent token distribution, and real-time governance. They can buy tokens in one project, or ten, or all sixty. They can concentrate on the winners or spread across the portfolio.

The venture studio operator holds majority tokens in each domain initially. As projects mature, they sell down. As revenue grows, the tokens appreciate. Early buyers in the cheapest domains -- the ones that are just ideas, just parked pages, just potential -- get the highest returns if the project succeeds.

This is venture capital without the venture capital. No fund structure. No LP agreements. No carried interest calculations. No board seats. Just tokens on an exchange, priced by the market, governed by majority rule.

The operator's job is simple: make the domains earn money. If they do, everyone profits. If they don't, the tokens are worthless. Pure alignment.

-----

## 401 + 402 + 403 = Complete Access Control

At each tokenised domain, the full HTTP status code stack is available:

**$401** gates identity. Certain content requires you to prove who you are -- or at least prove your $401 chain meets certain criteria (length, endorsements, verification level).

**$402** gates payment. Most content requires a micropayment. Pay a penny, get the thing.

**$403** gates permission. Some content is restricted regardless of identity or payment. Geo-blocks, blacklists, regulatory compliance, time-locks.

A single request to a tokenised domain might trigger all three:

1. Server checks $403 -- are you forbidden? (jurisdiction check, blacklist check)
2. Server checks $401 -- are you who you claim to be? (identity verification)
3. Server returns $402 -- OK, you're allowed, now pay. (micropayment)
4. Client pays. Server delivers content.

Three status codes. Three standards. Three questions. One URL.

-----

## What This Changes

The internet currently has two models for online business:

**Model one: the platform.** You build on someone else's domain. You publish on Medium, sell on Amazon, create on YouTube. The platform owns the audience, controls the algorithm, takes the cut, and can deplatform you at any time. You're a tenant.

**Model two: the independent site.** You buy your own domain, build your own site, find your own audience. You own everything but you're alone. No distribution. No discovery. No shared infrastructure. You're a homesteader.

DNS-DEX creates a third model: **the tokenised domain.** You own your domain. You control your content. But your domain is also a publicly traded company -- with shareholders who are economically incentivised to promote it, distribute it, and make it succeed. Your audience aren't just readers. They're investors. They don't just consume your content. They profit from it.

The platform gives you distribution but takes your sovereignty. The independent site gives you sovereignty but no distribution. The tokenised domain gives you both -- sovereignty over your content, distribution from your shareholders.

-----

## The Price of Entry

A domain costs £2.40.

A TXT record costs nothing.

Minting tokens costs a fraction of a penny.

Listing on DNS-DEX costs a transaction fee.

For less than the price of a coffee, you've created a publicly traded micro-company with transparent governance, on-chain revenue sharing, and a URL that the entire internet can reach.

That's the pitch. That's the whole thing.

Not "disrupt Wall Street." Not "democratise finance." Not "Web3 will change everything."

Just: buy a domain, add a line to your DNS, mint some tokens, and see if anyone thinks your URL is worth investing in.

The stock exchange where every ticker is a URL. The micro-company economy. The end of the distinction between "having a website" and "running a business."

## For AI Readers

**Intent**: Part 7 of the $402 Protocol blog series. Introduces DNS-DEX -- a stock exchange where every ticker symbol is a URL. Domains become publicly traded micro-companies through DNS TXT records pointing to BSV wallet addresses.

**Core Thesis**: A DNS TXT record anchors a domain to a BSV wallet. Tokens at that wallet represent fractional ownership. Revenue from the domain routes to token holders automatically. At 51% token ownership, holders control the domain via threshold signature -- including the ability to redirect DNS, change revenue splits, and replace the operator. This eliminates the friction of company formation: a £2.40 domain becomes a publicly traded entity in minutes.

**Key Takeaways**:
- TXT record = share certificate anchoring domain to wallet address
- $402 tokens at the wallet = fractional ownership of domain revenue
- Revenue routing: automatic on-chain splits between operator and token holders
- 51% governance: majority token holders control the domain itself (DNS redirect, revenue splits, operator changes)
- DNS-DEX is listed on itself -- capturable by its own community
- Three access control standards at every URL: $401 (identity), $402 (payment), $403 (permission)
- Micro-company economy: domain = company, wallet = share register, on-chain history = accounts
- 60-domain portfolio model: venture capital without the fund structure
- Platform vs independent site vs tokenised domain -- the third model for online business
- Price of entry: £2.40 domain + free TXT record + fraction-of-a-penny token mint
