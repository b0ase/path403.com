You want to let people invest in you. Not in a company. In you - your work, your projects, whatever you build over time.

Here's how to do it legally, transparently, and without spending thousands on lawyers.

## The Problem

Traditional investment requires a company. You incorporate, issue shares, maintain registers, file accounts, pay fees. For a small creator or solo builder, that's overhead that kills most ideas before they start.

Crypto promised to fix this, but delivered casinos. Memecoins, rugs, unregistered securities dressed up as "utility tokens." The infrastructure exists to issue tokens. The infrastructure to make them *mean something* doesn't.

So you're stuck: either incorporate and drown in admin, or issue tokens that have no legal standing.

## The Solution

A peer token is a claim on future value, recorded on-chain, tied to a verified identity.

Not a company. Not a memecoin. A public record that says:

- This is who I am (verified)
- This is what I'm building
- This token represents X% of my earnings/profits/revenue from Y
- Here's the full history of who owns what

That's it. No incorporation required. Just a registry, verification, and transparency.

## Why It Works

**Public and Immutable Registry** - Every token issuance, every transfer, every dividend payment is recorded on-chain. Can't be backdated. Can't be hidden. Anyone can audit it. This is actually *better* than Companies House, which just records what you tell them and doesn't verify anything.

**Verified Identity** - Before you can issue tokens, you get KYC verified. A real human checks your ID. Your wallet is linked to a verified identity. This means token holders know who they're dealing with. Not an anon. A person with a name, accountable for what they promised.

**Explicit Terms** - When you issue a peer token, you state what it represents. Percentage of revenue from a specific project? Share of profits from everything you build? Rights to dividends paid quarterly? It's written down, on-chain, at the point of issuance. No ambiguity.

**Tracked Transfers** - When tokens change hands, the registry updates. The cap table is always current. Everyone can see who owns what.

**On-Chain Dividends** - When you earn money and distribute it, that's recorded too. Token holders receive stablecoin payments proportional to their holdings. Transparent, verifiable, automatic.

## What About Legal Standing?

Here's the key insight: if the terms of the token (like articles of association) are inscribed on-chain at the point of mint and attached to a verified identity, courts can enforce contract law based on that immutable record.

This is actually **stronger** than traditional company registration:

- **Articles of association must be published** - Company law already requires this. An on-chain inscription does the same thing, but immutably.
- **Courts recognize written contracts** - The terms inscribed at mint constitute a binding agreement. Courts enforce contracts all the time.
- **Better audit trail than Companies House** - Companies House records what you tell them. The blockchain records what you actually did, timestamped and immutable.
- **Verified identity** - You know exactly who issued the token. No shell companies. No nominee directors. A real person accountable under contract law.
- **Transparent enforcement** - Every dividend payment, every transfer, every commitment is on the public record. Courts love clear evidence.

If someone issues peer tokens with on-chain terms and then refuses to honor them, they've broken a contract. Courts enforce contracts. The fact that it's not registered with Companies House doesn't matter - it's still a legally binding agreement between verified parties.

The blockchain provides **better** evidence than traditional corporate records because it can't be backdated, edited, or lost.

## When to Incorporate

If you need a bank account in the company's name, limited liability protection, or institutional investors who can only invest in registered entities - then incorporate. The on-chain registry doesn't prevent that. It supports it.

You can register on b0ase first, build a track record, gather token holders - and incorporate later when it makes sense. The on-chain terms can reference the corporate structure. One doesn't replace the other; they complement each other.

Many builders start with peer tokens to validate demand and build a community, then incorporate when they need the specific features of a company. The blockchain record provides the continuity - you can prove the history of who contributed what, even before incorporation.

## The Tools

Everything needed to make this work:

**/registry** - Register yourself, your projects, your tokens

**/verify** - Get KYC verified by a real human

**/mint** - Create tokens representing whatever you're offering

**/cap** - View and model your cap table

**/dividends** - Distribute earnings to token holders

**/transfer** - Record when tokens change hands

Simple tools. Public records. Verified identities.

## Who This Is For

**Builders** who want to let their community invest in them without the overhead of incorporation.

**Creators** who want to share upside with early supporters, not just sell merch.

**Small investors** who want equity in people they believe in, not just donations.

**Anyone** locked out of traditional capital markets who still wants to raise funds and share success.

## Who This Isn't For

Anyone who needs **institutional investors** - many funds and VCs can only invest in registered companies due to their own compliance requirements.

Anyone who needs **limited liability protection** - that's a feature of incorporated entities, not contracts.

Anyone who needs **a bank account in the company name** - banks require incorporation.

This is peer-to-peer investment based on transparent contracts and verified identities. The legal standing is strong (contract law applies), but some features of corporate structure require incorporation. Choose the tool that fits your needs.

## The Point

The infrastructure for peer-to-peer ownership shouldn't require lawyers, accountants, and government filings.

It should require: verified identity, clear terms, public records, and transparent distributions.

That's what peer tokens provide.

b0ase.com is building the tools. $BOASE is the first example - a peer token representing equity in everything built here.

Not hype. Not a revolution. Just a simpler way to let people invest in people.
