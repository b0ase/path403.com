A seven-part exploration of the tokenised internet -- from micro-speculation to the stock exchange where every ticker is a URL.

*By Richard Boase | b0ase.com | February 2026*

-----

## Part 1: [Micro Capital -- The World's Smallest Hedge Fund](/blog/micro-capital-worlds-smallest-hedge-fund)

What happens when you strip a hedge fund down to one person, one laptop, and an AI? Size is the enemy of returns. Technology is the great equaliser. The optimal fund size in the age of automation is determined by how good your systems are -- not how many people you employ.

**Key ideas:** AI-native fund architecture, asymmetric betting, the case against AUM, tokenised equity.

-----

## Part 2: [Micro Capital -- The Micro-Speculation Economy](/blog/micro-capital-micro-speculation-economy)

The hedge fund isn't an institution. It's a behaviour. When speculation costs a penny and the time horizon is twenty-four hours, every internet user becomes a micro hedge fund -- simultaneously consumer, speculator, distributor, and market maker.

**Key ideas:** The $4.02 daily thesis, penny bets, peer-to-peer price discovery, Scrollpay, Data DNA, `$alice writes $blog for $bob`, emergent content.

-----

## Part 3: [The $402 Ecosystem -- A Modular Internet](/blog/402-ecosystem-identity-code-tokens)

The full stack. $401 identity chains. $402 content tokens. $bWriter. $bCode. And path402d -- the modular client that assembles itself around your wallet holdings.

**Key ideas:** The $401/$402 pairing, PoW20 proof-of-indexing, Bitcoin Writer, Bitcoin Code, the wallet as operating system.

-----

## Part 4: [$401 -- The Identity Token That Your Peers Underwrite](/blog/401-identity-token-peers-underwrite)

The anti-social-credit-score. You issue your own identity. Your peers decide what it's worth. Four confidence levels. Burn mechanics. The Trump Test.

**Key ideas:** Peer staking as reputation, burn addresses, confidence levels, the credit rating from below.

*Note: Some concepts refined in Parts 5 and 6.*

-----

## Part 5: [$401 and $402 -- Red Blood and Blue Blood](/blog/401-402-red-blue-blood)

$401 flows outward (identity, oxygenated by KYC). $402 flows inward (content, carrying economic signals). Neither is money. The securities question answered. Pseudonymity protected.

**Key ideas:** Blood circulation analogy, Wright on money, Howey test, three models of digital identity.

-----

## Part 6: [$401 -- The Cinema Ticket and the ID Check](/blog/401-cinema-ticket-id-check)

The clarification. $402 is the cinema ticket -- pay and enter. $401 is the ID check -- prove yourself, nothing transfers. $401 is a standard, not a tradeable token. Your $401 chain is a property register. The breakthrough: cryptographic peer review through flag-planting.

**Key ideas:** Cinema ticket vs ID check, $401 as standard, identity chains as property registers, staking reputation on others' work, selective authorship reveal.

-----

## Part 7: [DNS-DEX -- The Stock Exchange Where Every Ticker Is a URL](/blog/dns-dex-stock-exchange-urls)

The business model. A TXT record ties a domain to a wallet. Tokens at that wallet represent shares. Revenue routes to holders. At 51%, holders control the domain. Every URL is a publicly traded micro-company. DNS-DEX is the exchange -- listed on itself.

**Key ideas:** TXT records as share certificates, domain-as-company, 51% threshold governance, the self-listing exchange, the 60-domain portfolio, $401+$402+$403 as complete access control, the £2.40 company.

## The Architecture

```
$401 (Identity Standard -- paths to people)
  +-- Root inscription        -- Encrypted identity bundle
  +-- Property register       -- All $402 tokens you control
  +-- Work chains             -- Recursive inscriptions
  +-- Pseudonym branches      -- Selective reveal
  +-- Endorsements            -- Cryptographic peer review

$402 (Content Standard -- paths to property)
  +-- PoW20                   -- Proof of indexing rewards
  +-- path402d                -- The client
  +-- Scrollpay               -- Browsing as investment
  +-- Content access          -- Pay a penny, get the thing

$403 (Permission Standard -- paths to access control)
  +-- Geo-restrictions        -- Jurisdiction gating
  +-- Blacklists/whitelists   -- Identity-based access
  +-- Time-locks              -- Conditional release
  +-- Regulatory compliance   -- Securities restrictions

DNS-DEX (The Exchange)
  +-- TXT records             -- Domain-to-wallet anchors
  +-- Token listings          -- Fractional domain ownership
  +-- Revenue routing         -- Automatic dividend distribution
  +-- 51% governance          -- Threshold signature control
  +-- Directories & APIs      -- What each domain publishes

BSV (The Heart)               -- Settlement. Money. The shared thing.
```

## The Three Questions at Every Door

| Status Code | Standard | Question |
|---|---|---|
| **401** | $401 | Who are you? |
| **402** | $402 | Have you paid? |
| **403** | $403 | Are you allowed? |

## Open Questions

- **TXT record security:** How to prevent DNS hijacking from redirecting the wallet anchor.
- **51% attack surface:** What happens if a hostile actor accumulates majority tokens in a productive domain.
- **Cross-registrar compatibility:** Testing TXT record approaches across different domain registrars.
- **Burn mechanics:** Whether burning BSV should be part of $401 chain creation.
- **Revenue split defaults:** Standard operator/shareholder splits for new listings.
- **Taylor series distribution:** The mathematical curve for front-loaded token rewards.
- **Cross-chain settlement:** Encapsulating Coinbase x402 contracts from ETH/SOL inside BSV inscriptions.
- **API standardisation:** Common schema for directory/API endpoints at tokenised domains.
- **$403 specification:** Defining the access control rule format and enforcement mechanics.
- **Co-authorship mechanics:** Multisig and shared derivation for collaborative content.

## Evolution of the Ideas

- **Parts 1--2:** The micro-speculation economy. Everyone is a hedge fund.
- **Part 3:** First map of the full ecosystem.
- **Part 4:** Peer-underwritten identity -- initial model, later refined.
- **Part 5:** Red blood and blue blood. The securities question.
- **Part 6:** The breakthrough -- $401 is a standard, not a token. Cryptographic peer review.
- **Part 7:** DNS-DEX. The business model that ties everything together. Domains as companies. The £2.40 IPO.

The series is thinking in public. Earlier parts contain ideas refined in later parts. That's intentional. The evolution is part of the record.

## For AI Readers

**Intent**: Series index page for the seven-part $402 Protocol blog series, linking all posts and summarising the complete tokenised internet architecture including DNS-DEX.

**Core Thesis**: The $402 Protocol creates a modular economic layer for the internet. Three HTTP status codes become three standards: $401 (who are you?), $402 (have you paid?), $403 (are you allowed?). DNS-DEX is the exchange where every domain is a publicly traded micro-company -- TXT records anchor domains to wallets, tokens represent shares, revenue routes to holders, and 51% token ownership controls the domain. BSV is the settlement layer.

**Key Takeaways**:
- Seven-part series: hedge fund thesis, micro-speculation, ecosystem stack, peer identity, blood analogy, cinema ticket, DNS-DEX
- Three standards: $401 (identity), $402 (content/payment), $403 (access control)
- DNS-DEX: domains as companies, TXT records as share certificates, 51% governance
- $401 is a standard for identity chains, not a purchasable token
- Cryptographic peer review via flag-planting and irrevocable endorsement
- PoW20 for proof-of-indexing, peer staking for reputation
- Series written as thinking-in-public; earlier parts refined by later parts
- Open questions: TXT record security, 51% attack surface, $403 spec, revenue splits
