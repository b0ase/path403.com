## What is the Metanet?

The [Metanet](/metanet) is b0ase's 3D visualization of the entire portfolio ecosystem. It's not just a pretty display—it's a map of how value flows through Bitcoin-native applications.

Every glowing node is a real project. Every pulsing connection represents shared infrastructure, token relationships, or user flows. The central hub? That's b0ase itself—the venture studio connecting everything together.

## The Technical Architecture

Built with Three.js and WebGL, the Metanet renders 30+ projects in real-time 3D space with:

- **Fibonacci sphere distribution** - Projects are positioned using the golden ratio for optimal visual spacing
- **Unreal Bloom post-processing** - That neon glow isn't CSS—it's actual light emission in 3D space
- **Custom GLSL shaders** - Connections pulse with morphing purple-to-red gradients
- **CSS2D labels** - Interactive pill-style labels float in 3D space but render as crisp HTML

The result is something that feels alive. Projects pulse. Connections flow. The camera slowly orbits around the ecosystem like you're watching a galaxy form.

## Reading the Visualization

**Node Colors Tell Status:**
- 🟢 **Green glow** = Live and running
- 🟡 **Yellow glow** = Beta or development
- ⚪ **Gray glow** = Archived or concept

**Connections Show Relationships:**
Projects within 20 units of each other are connected. This isn't random—it reflects actual relationships: shared tech stacks, token ecosystems, or user bases.

**The Central Hub:**
The pulsing red core with the purple wireframe icosahedron is b0ase itself. Every project connects back to it with subtle radial lines. This is literal—b0ase builds and maintains every project in the network.

## Why Visualize a Portfolio This Way?

Traditional portfolio pages are lists. Grids. Cards. They show you projects one at a time, in isolation.

But that's not how an ecosystem works.

Projects in the b0ase universe share tokens. They share users. Bitcoin Spreadsheets and Bitcoin Writer share the same authentication. FLOOP and Tribes Wallet share the same token infrastructure. Miss Void and Ninja Punk Girls share the same e-commerce engine.

The Metanet makes these connections visible. You can literally see which projects cluster together. You can see how live projects (green) anchor the network while beta projects (yellow) push outward into new territory.

## The MoneyButton Connection

Every project in the Metanet can be funded through the [MoneyButton](/moneybuttons) system. Press a button, pay less than a penny, receive tokens from any project in the network.

The Metanet visualizes where those tokens live. Click a node, explore the project, then head to MoneyButton to start accumulating ownership. It's not just visualization—it's navigation for an entire micro-economy.

Read more about how MoneyButton reaches $10M in our [MoneyButton thesis](/blog/moneybutton-path-to-10-million).

## Interacting with the Metanet

**Orbit:** Click and drag to rotate the camera around the ecosystem

**Zoom:** Scroll to zoom in and out (20-100 unit range)

**Hover:** Float over any project pill to see it highlighted

**Click:** Click any node or label to open that project in a new tab

The visualization auto-rotates slowly, but you can take control at any time. Explore at your own pace.

## The Bigger Picture

The Metanet isn't just for show. It's a prototype of how value networks should be visualized.

Bitcoin enables micropayments. BSV enables on-chain data. Together, they enable ecosystems where dozens of applications can share users, tokens, and infrastructure without intermediaries.

But how do you show that to someone? How do you explain that pressing a button on MoneyButton might give you tokens from a project you've never heard of, which connects to five other projects you also own pieces of?

You show them the Metanet.

You let them orbit around 30+ projects and see how they cluster. You let them click through and discover that the ecosystem is deeper than any single landing page could convey.
