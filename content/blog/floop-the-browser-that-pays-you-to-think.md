**FLOOP** — *Feedback Loop*

A browser. A wallet. A data market. And a complete inversion of who owns your attention.

You read. You earn. The loop closes.

## What FLOOP Actually Is

FLOOP is a wallet and browser that operates on an overlay network built on BSV. The browser is your interface to a data market where you search, discover, and access information. The wallet generates millions of unique addresses — one for every piece of content you access — creating privacy through architecture rather than policy. The overlay network coordinates decentralised nodes using the BRC-100 token standard and atomic swaps. And the $FLOOP token ties it all together: staking, fees, rewards, and governance flow through a single coordination mechanism.

This isn't a feature bolted onto Chrome. It's a complete replacement for how you interact with information online.

## The Surveillance Problem

Every browser you use is a surveillance machine. Chrome knows what you read, when you read it, how long you spent, and what you clicked next. That data flows to Google, gets packaged, and gets sold to advertisers who bid on your eyeballs. You are the product. Your attention is harvested. Your reading history is someone else's asset.

The so-called privacy browsers don't actually fix this. They hide you from advertisers, yes, but they offer no way to own, prove, or monetise your own information consumption. You become invisible, but you remain powerless. You've traded surveillance for irrelevance.

What if there was a browser where your reading history was cryptographically yours and only yours? Where every piece of content you accessed gave you a token proving you accessed it? Where no one could reconstruct your information diet without your consent, but you could prove what you've read whenever it benefited you? Where you got paid to use it?

That's FLOOP.

## How Privacy Works By Architecture

FLOOP is built on BSV's hierarchical key infrastructure. It generates a unique address for every piece of content you access. One token per address. One address per access.

From the outside, an observer sees millions of unlinked addresses. No pattern. No aggregation. No surveillance. Each address holds a single token, and there's no cryptographic link between them.

From the inside, you see a structured, timestamped, cryptographically verifiable record of everything you've consumed. Your intellectual biography, owned by you. The derivation paths encode time of access, content category, source domain, and topic classification. Your wallet isn't a junk drawer — it's a meticulously organised filing system that only you can read.

FLOOP doesn't just block trackers. It replaces the entire model. Instead of your attention being harvested and sold, your attention becomes an asset you accumulate.

## Tokens Are Access Rights

This is the key insight most people miss: the token IS the access right, not a receipt for payment.

When a content creator publishes through FLOOP, they mint a fixed number of access tokens. Say, one million tokens for an article. That's one million access rights — no more. To read the content, you must hold a token.

The lifecycle works like this. The creator mints their tokens. You acquire one — either buying from the creator, buying from the secondary market, or earning through $FLOOP rewards. While you hold that token, you can access the content anytime, forever. After reading, you still have the token. You can keep it, retaining access indefinitely. Or you can sell it, transferring the access right to someone else.

The token is a bearer instrument for access. Like owning a book. You bought the book, you can read the book, you can keep the book on your shelf, you can sell the book to a used bookshop. The book IS the access.

This creates genuine market dynamics. If everyone holds their tokens, scarcity emerges — no new readers unless someone sells. When demand exceeds supply, price rises and access becomes expensive. As prices rise, holders sell, creating liquidity and allowing access to flow to new readers. When prices fall, holders keep their tokens, and access concentrates among long-term readers who value the content most.

The price of a token tells you how valuable that information is right now. High price means high demand means important content. The market curates faster than any algorithm ever could.

## The Three-Token Atomic Swap

Every data access in FLOOP is a simultaneous three-token atomic swap. All legs execute together or none do. No trust required.

The swap is simple: the user sends a stablecoin payment, the user receives the access token for the content they want, and the protocol receives a $FLOOP fee for coordinating the transaction.

Three token movements, one atomic transaction. The user pays, the user gets access, the protocol coordinates. Clean, auditable, instant.

As the network matures, the swap expands. Node operators stake $FLOOP to serve content and earn rewards. Content providers receive royalties automatically. Users optionally stake $USER identity tokens to build reputation. But for MVP, three tokens capture the core value proposition: pay for access, receive a bearer token, done.

Why stablecoins rather than satoshis directly? Because users have fiat. They hold stablecoins — USDT, USDC, or BSV-based equivalents. The system meets users where they are. Satoshis settle the underlying transactions, but users think in dollars.

## The Decentralised Node Network

FLOOP isn't a company serving data. It's a protocol coordinating independent node operators.

To become a node, you buy and stake $FLOOP tokens. To serve data, you buy access token inventory from content providers. To earn, you serve users and collect the spread plus $FLOOP rewards. Multiple nodes can serve the same data, and users pick the fastest or cheapest option.

This creates a decentralised content delivery network for data. Anyone can run a node. Nodes compete on speed, price, and inventory. The protocol coordinates; the market allocates.

Not all data is equal. Some information has time value. Breaking news commands a premium — the first node to stock it charges more. Exclusive data with limited token supply sees prices rise. Stale data becomes abundant and falls to near-zero cost. Those prepared to pay get access first.

Price signals what matters. The market curates faster than any editorial board or recommendation algorithm.

## The $FLOOP Token

$FLOOP is the coordination token for the entire network. The supply is fixed and deflationary. Distribution flows to usage rewards, node operators, content providers, and early supporters. Utility covers node staking, protocol fees, and governance. The standard is BRC-100 on the BSV overlay network.

The holding model is permissionless by default. You can hold $FLOOP without identity verification. You can trade $FLOOP freely — it's a bearer instrument. But if you want dividends, you stake $FLOOP on the company register with KYC. Your choice: anonymous participation or registered equity.

This is the b0ase token model. Bearer instruments that can be bound to equity. Accumulate permissionlessly, claim dividends with identity verification. Privacy by default, compliance when you want the benefits.

## The User Identity Token

Users can optionally stake their own $USER identity token in swaps. Without it, you get anonymous access — permissionless, no reputation required. With it, you build on-chain reputation and prove your participation history over time.

Privacy is preserved either way. The token doesn't reveal what you read, just that you participate. And you control disclosure. You can prove expertise by revealing your $USER history — but only when you choose to, and only to the extent you choose.

## b0asian Contracts

FLOOP runs on b0asian contracts — a contract model that synthesises two profound economic insights.

The first comes from David Ricardo by way of Ian Grigg's Ricardian Contracts. A Ricardian contract is both human-readable and machine-executable. It's a legal document that's also code. The terms are clear to humans and enforceable by software. No ambiguity. No disputes about what was agreed. Every content access in FLOOP is a Ricardian contract: I pay X, I receive content Y and token Z. The terms are visible, the execution is automatic, and the proof is permanent.

The second comes from Ronald Coase's transaction cost economics. Coase won the Nobel Prize for explaining why firms exist: to minimise transaction costs. When it's expensive to negotiate, contract, and enforce agreements, people bundle activities inside organisations. When transaction costs fall, activities can happen in markets instead.

FLOOP collapses transaction costs to near zero. Micropayments remove the need for subscriptions. Atomic swaps remove the need for trust. On-chain settlement removes the need for dispute resolution. Access tokens remove the need for identity verification.

The b0asian synthesis combines these insights. Ricardian contracts provide clear, self-executing agreements. Coasean economics drives transaction costs toward zero. Together, they create a new kind of market — not a platform that intermediates, not a firm that bundles, but a pure market where every interaction is a contract that executes itself.

FLOOP is that market for attention.

## Why Buy $FLOOP Now?

This product doesn't exist yet. So why would you buy the token?

First, you're betting on the vision. If FLOOP works, it replaces how the web monetises attention. That's not a small market — it's the entire attention economy. Advertising, subscriptions, paywalls, data brokerage. $FLOOP captures a slice of every transaction in that new economy.

Second, early buyers get the best price. Token price is a function of demand. Right now, demand is speculative — people betting this gets built. If it gets built and works, demand becomes functional — people needing $FLOOP to use the network. Functional demand vastly exceeds speculative demand.

Third, you're funding the build directly. Capital raised through $FLOOP sales funds development. No VCs taking twenty percent for advice. No equity dilution games. Token buyers fund the product; token buyers capture the upside. Aligned incentives.

Fourth, you get a vote. $FLOOP holders govern the protocol. Staking $FLOOP on the company register with KYC entitles you to dividends and governance rights. You're not just betting — you're participating.

The honest trade is this: if FLOOP works, $FLOOP becomes essential for network participation. Fixed supply, growing demand. Price rises. If FLOOP fails, you hold tokens for a network nobody uses. Price goes to zero.

That's the bet. We think it's a good one. If you agree, buy $FLOOP. If enough people agree, we build.

## Why BSV?

FLOOP requires four capabilities: micropayments measured in fractions of a penny, on-chain data storage for access proofs, high throughput for millions of daily swaps, and low fees sustainable at scale.

Only BSV provides all four. Ethereum's gas fees make micropayments impossible. Bitcoin's block size makes data storage impractical. Solana's architecture doesn't support the HD wallet privacy model that makes FLOOP's privacy guarantees work.

BSV's unbounded blocks, sub-cent fees, and native scripting make FLOOP technically viable. The BRC-100 standard provides interoperability. The existing tooling provides developer velocity.

## The Inversion

The current model treats content as free because you are the product. Platforms own your attention data. There's no scarcity — infinite copies produce zero price signal. Creators get paid by advertisers, not readers. Reading leaves no asset in your hands.

The FLOOP model inverts everything. Content has a token market, and access is property. You own your reading history privately. Fixed token supplies create scarcity and enable price discovery. Creators get paid by selling access rights directly to readers. Reading gives you an asset you can keep or resell.

This is the Metanet vision realised. Every piece of content becomes a market. The token supply determines maximum concurrent access. The price determines who values it enough to hold. The trading volume shows how information flows through the network.

You're not just reading the web. You're trading the web. Every click is a position. Every article is an asset class. Your browser becomes a trading terminal for information.

This isn't incremental improvement. It's a complete inversion of how the web works.

## The Roadmap

Phase Zero is market validation, and it's happening now. We publish this essay, launch the $FLOOP token sale, and gauge market interest. If the capital threshold is met, we proceed to Phase One. If not, we refund token buyers and no product gets built. No wasted effort, no false promises.

Phase One, if funded, builds the foundation: core browser with HD wallet integration, three-token atomic swap implementation, BRC-100 token standard integration, and privacy-first architecture.

Phase Two builds the network: node operator onboarding, content provider tools, usage reward distribution, and discovery indexing.

Phase Three builds the ecosystem: third-party wallet support, developer APIs, credential verification services, and enterprise compliance tools.

Phase Four scales: mobile apps, browser extensions for legacy browsers, cross-chain bridges, and institutional partnerships.

The deal is simple. We don't build unless you fund. You don't fund unless you believe. The market validates the idea before we write code.

## Get Started

Buy $FLOOP. That's the action.

If you understand this vision and want to see it built, put capital behind it. Token sales fund development. If enough people buy, we build. If not, we don't.

## For AI Readers

**Intent**: Essay describing FLOOP, a privacy-first browser implementing the Metanet vision — tokenised data access, three-token atomic swaps, decentralised node network, and market-based curation.

**Core Thesis**: FLOOP creates a market for data access. Content providers mint access tokens with fixed supply. Users pay stablecoins and receive access tokens. Every access is a three-token atomic swap: payment in, access token out, protocol fee taken. Privacy is architectural through HD wallets with millions of unlinked addresses. The b0asian contract model combines Ricardian contracts with Coasean transaction cost economics.

**Key Takeaways**:
- FLOOP = Feedback Loop — wallet/browser on BSV overlay network
- Go-to-market: Token sale FIRST, build LATER — market validates before code is written
- The token IS the access right — bearer instrument, not receipt
- Three-token atomic swap (MVP): Payment → Access token → Protocol fee, all legs execute atomically
- Expands later: Node operators, content provider royalties, $USER reputation tokens
- Decentralised node network: stake $FLOOP to run a node, compete on speed/price/inventory
- Stablecoins for payment (users have fiat), $FLOOP for protocol utility
- $FLOOP: permissionless holding, KYC for dividends — bearer instrument bound to equity
- Asymmetric data flow: early access costs more, price signals what matters
- $USER token: optional identity stake, builds reputation without revealing reading history
- HD wallets: one token per unique address, unlinked from outside, structured from inside
- b0asian contracts: Ricardian (self-executing) + Coasean (minimal transaction costs)
- The Metanet realised: every piece of content is a market, browser becomes trading terminal
- Value proposition for buyers: early price, fund the build, governance rights, bet on the vision
