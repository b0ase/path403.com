Vibe-coding changed how software gets built. You describe what you want, AI writes the code, you ship it. The barrier to building dropped to nearly zero.

Vibe-coins are the obvious next step. Half-built product, promising idea, no funding? Launch a token. Let the crowd decide if it's worth betting on. The barrier to fundraising is about to drop the same way.

This is going to create chaos. And we're trying to figure out how to navigate it before it arrives.

## The Pump.fun Problem

Pump.fun made token launches trivially easy. Anyone could create a memecoin in seconds. Some made fortunes. Many lost everything. The platform became synonymous with speculation, rugs, and regulatory action.

The UK banned access to it. The FCA doesn't play around.

But here's the thing: pump.fun wasn't wrong about the technology. It was wrong about the responsibility. Making something easy doesn't mean making it reckless. The problem wasn't that anyone could launch a token — it was that no one was accountable when things went wrong.

We're not interested in being the next pump.fun. We're interested in what comes after: a middle ground where token issuance is accessible but not lawless, where speculation is possible but not predatory.

## What Vibe-Coders Will Do

Vibe-coders are already building MVPs in hours instead of months. The next phase is predictable:

1. Build something half-working
2. Need money to finish it
3. Traditional fundraising is slow, exclusive, annoying
4. Token launch is instant, global, permissionless
5. Launch token, raise funds, keep building

This isn't hypothetical. It's already happening in crypto-native circles. As vibe-coding spreads to mainstream developers, vibe-coins will follow.

The question isn't whether this will happen. It's whether it will happen inside or outside the law.

## Securities Law Doesn't Care About Your Vibes

A token is probably a security if:
- Buyers expect profits from the issuer's efforts
- There's an investment of money
- In a common enterprise
- With profits derived from others

This is the Howey Test (US) and similar principles apply in the UK under FSMA. The name "vibecoin" doesn't change the analysis. The technology doesn't change the analysis. The only thing that matters is the economic reality.

If someone buys a token hoping the project team will build something valuable and the token will appreciate, that's an investment. If the token promises dividends, revenue share, or profit participation, it's almost certainly a security.

Calling it a "utility token" or a "community token" or a "vibecoin" is marketing, not law.

## The Middle Ground We're Looking For

So where does that leave vibe-coders who want to fund their projects?

We think there's a legitimate path, but it requires more care than pump.fun offered:

**1. Genuine utility, not promised returns**

A token that grants access to software, API calls, or platform features is harder to classify as a security than one that promises profit sharing. The token has to actually do something beyond "go up in value."

**2. Clear disclaimers, aggressively honest**

Not legal protection, but cultural protection. If every token launch comes with "this might be worthless, we might fail, there are no promises" — repeated loudly and often — the market develops different expectations.

**3. Small enough to ignore**

This is uncomfortable but true: regulators have limited resources. A token launch raising £500 from friends and believers is different from one raising £5 million from strangers. The law doesn't officially distinguish, but enforcement does.

**4. Known participants**

Anonymous tokens are convenient for scammers. Identified issuers with reputations to protect behave differently. KYC isn't required at small scales, but voluntary transparency changes incentives.

**5. No fiat touchpoints**

The FCA's authority kicks in most clearly when crypto meets pounds. Token-for-token exchanges, crypto-only purchases, wallet-to-wallet transfers — these create regulatory ambiguity that might work in your favour.

## What We're Building

b0ase.com is building infrastructure for exactly this scenario. The /exchange we're creating isn't meant to compete with Coinbase. It's meant to demonstrate that anyone can host a crypto exchange — that the technology is accessible, that vibe-coding makes it possible.

The point isn't to build THE exchange. It's to prove that exchange infrastructure can be commoditised, that projects can run their own token markets, that the middlemen aren't necessary.

But we're trying to do it in a way that doesn't get us banned. The UK is home. The FCA is real. Pump.fun's approach — maximum accessibility, zero accountability — isn't available to us.

So we're thinking about:

**Custody that isn't custody**: 2-of-3 multisig where users hold 2 keys. We can't move their funds. They can move them without us. We're a backup, not a custodian.

**Disclaimers that mean something**: Not legal armour, but genuine communication. Every token comes with risk disclosure. Every purchase requires acknowledgment. Nobody can claim they didn't know.

**Utility-first token design**: Tokens that do things — grant access, enable features, represent usage rights — rather than tokens that just promise appreciation.

**Transparent issuers**: b0ase-launched tokens come from b0ase. Our reputation is on the line. We're not hiding behind anonymity.

## The Uncomfortable Questions

We don't have all the answers. Some questions we're still working through:

**Can you issue dividend-bearing tokens legally?** Probably not without securities registration. But buyback mechanisms, utility credits, and governance rights might achieve similar economic effects without crossing the line.

**What's the minimum viable compliance?** AML registration if touching fiat. Honest disclaimers always. Utility-first design. Beyond that, it's judgment calls and risk tolerance.

**Will the FCA come after small projects?** Probably not, unless there's fraud or someone complains loudly. But "probably not" isn't legal advice, and enforcement patterns can change.

**Is this all just regulatory arbitrage?** Partly. But there's also a genuine question about whether securities laws designed for 20th-century capital markets make sense for 21st-century micro-tokens. We think they need updating. Until they are, we're working with what exists.

## Why We're Writing This

This blog post isn't legal advice. It's not even a plan. It's thinking out loud.

b0ase.com publishes these posts as a knowledge base — a record of what we're figuring out, written honestly enough that we can't lie to ourselves. Nobody's watching. Nobody's correcting us. The discipline has to be internal.

Vibe-coins are coming whether we're ready or not. The infrastructure will get built by someone. We'd rather it be built thoughtfully, by people who care about the outcomes, than recklessly by people chasing the next pump.fun.

If that means moving slower, accepting more constraints, and finding the boring middle ground between "anything goes" and "nothing's allowed" — that's what we're going to do.

The vibes are good. The legal situation is complicated. We're working on both.
