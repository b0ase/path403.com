TOKEN REGISTRY - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH (Jan 9, 2026)
======================================================

GOAL: Create lib/token-registry.ts as the single source of truth for ALL token data

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Token data scattered across lib/data.ts (~50+ projects with tokenName fields)
- Pricing data separate in lib/token-pricing.ts (only 3 real tokens)
- No central place to manage token metadata, status, pricing

PLAN:
1. [x] Create lib/token-registry.ts with:
   - TokenInfo interface (symbol, name, status, projectId, marketUrl, pricing)
   - TOKEN_REGISTRY object with all tokens
   - Helper functions: getToken(), getTokensByStatus(), etc.

2. [x] Migrate REAL_TOKENS from token-pricing.ts into registry

3. [x] Extract all tokenName values from data.ts projects into registry

4. [x] Update token-pricing.ts to use registry as source

5. [x] Update data.ts projects to reference registry (DONE)

STATUS: FULLY COMPLETED

CREATED FILES:
- lib/token-registry.ts - Single source of truth with 60+ tokens

UPDATED FILES:
- lib/token-pricing.ts - Now imports from token-registry (REAL_TOKENS derived from registry)
- lib/data.ts - Now imports token-registry, uses registry for $BOASE data, added validation

TOKENS IN REGISTRY:
- 3 minted company tokens: $BOASE, $NPG, $bCorp
- 8 bApps ecosystem tokens: $bMail, $bOs, $bDrive, $bSheets, $bWriter, $bApps, $bMusic, $bFile
- 45+ venture/project tokens
- 5 utility/investment tokens: $TECH, $COMPONENT, $MUSIC, $FLIX, $BOARDROOM

VALIDATION:
- 58 project tokens checked
- 0 missing from registry
- Dev mode will warn if any project uses an unregistered token

BUILD: PASSED
