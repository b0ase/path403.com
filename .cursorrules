# Cursor Rules: Enforcing JSX Standards

## JSX Syntax & Structure
- Ensure all JSX elements are correctly formed, with proper opening and closing tags.
- Verify correct attribute syntax (e.g., className vs class, quotes around string values).
- Check for proper nesting of elements.
- Validate syntax for fragments (`<>...</>`).

## JSX Logic & Rendering
- When mapping over arrays to create elements, ensure a unique `key` prop is provided for each element in the list.
- Verify that conditional rendering logic (e.g., `&&`, ternary operators) is clear, correct, and won't lead to unexpected rendering issues (like rendering `0` or `NaN`).
- Check for appropriate use of curly braces `{}` for embedding JavaScript expressions within JSX.
- Ensure event handlers are correctly passed as functions (e.g., `onClick={handleClick}` not `onClick={handleClick()}` unless intended).
